    to load applications without gpu support, load  the 'modtree/cpu' module.  Note that by default, 'modtree' will initialize your environment with a default
    set of modules  such as gcc and openmpi. If you want a different compiler/mpi environment or a different version,  please load the relevant modules
    explicitly.  The default gcc version in 'modtree/cpu' is 11.2.0. This has been selected to enable AMD Milan  specific optimizations in the compiler.
