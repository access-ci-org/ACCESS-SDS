    --looponfail: run your tests repeatedly in a subprocess. After each run pytest waits until a file in your project changes and then re-runs the previously failing
    tests. This is repeated until all tests pass after which again a full run is performed. * Multi-Platform coverage: you can specify different Python interpreters
    or different platforms and run tests in parallel on all of them. Before running tests remotely, pytest efficiently “rsyncs” your program source code to the
    remote place. All test results are reported back and displayed to your local terminal. You may specify different Python versions and interpreters.
