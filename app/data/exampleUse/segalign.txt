Use Case: SegAlign is a software tool for robust base-to-base alignment of long and error-prone sequence reads. It is primarily used in genomics and bioinformatics for comparing DNA sequences. 
  
Code details and examples: 

Before running SegAlign, the input files must be prepared. These include:
1. Reference Genome File: This should be a FASTA file (.fa) containing the DNA sequence of the reference genome.
   Example format:
   ```
   >chromosome_1
   ATGCTAGCTAGCTTGCTAGTAG
   TAGCTAGCTAGCT...
   ```

2. Query Sequences File: This should be in FASTQ format (.fastq) file containing the DNA sequence reads. 
   Example format:
   ```
   @read1
   ATGCTAGCTAGCTCGATCGATCC
   +
   IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII
   ```

You should have the following txt files ready in a directory,
1. The index file: This file contains the indexes of the reference genome. It is generated using the `create_index` command. Example: ref_index.txt
2. The seeds file: This file contains the seeds for the alignment. It is generated using the `crate seed` command. Example: seed.txt

Code Snippet: After preparing the reference genome and the DNA sequence reads files correctly, we can use the commands as follows:

To create the index:

```Shell
./segalign create_index ref.fa ref_index.txt
```

To create the seeds:

```Shell
./segalign create_seeds ref_index.txt seed.txt
```

Now, to perform the alignment:

```Shell
./segalign align --ref ref.fa --reads reads.fastq --seeds seed.txt > output.sam
```

In the above snippet, `ref.fa` is the reference sequence file, `reads.fastq` is the reads file and `seed.txt` is the seeds file. The output is a SAM file (`output.sam`) with the aligned sequences. 

Please note, this is a imagined example and actual commands and parameters might differ.
