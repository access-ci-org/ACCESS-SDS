Use Case: Running an ARM binary on a different machine (like x86).

Code details and examples:

Code:

Suppose we have an ARM executable named `hello`. We want to run it on a QEMU emulator on an x86 machine.

The binary file `hello` could be a simple "Hello, World!" program compiled for ARM. Its contents are irrelevant for the case, it's only important that it's a valid ARM binary.

The command to run the ARM binary using QEMU would be:

```
qemu-arm -L /usr/arm-linux-gnueabi/ hello
```

This command assumes that:

- `qemu-arm` is the QEMU emulator for the ARM processor. This may vary depending on the version of ARM your binary is targeting.

- `-L` /usr/arm-linux-gnueabi/ allows us to specify the location of the "sysroot". This folder should contains the libraries needed by the `hello` binary. This may vary depending on your specific setup.

- `hello` is the ARM binary we want to run.

Several input/output/error redirections, environment variables and command line arguments can be passed after the binary name.

Again, please note that paths, binary names and ARM versions may vary broadly depending on your specific needs and setup.
