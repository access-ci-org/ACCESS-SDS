Use Case: Trilinos is a highly modular scientific software under the HPC (High Performance Computing) tools. It can be used for solving system of linear equations, eigenvalue problems, and includes support for parallel computing.

Code Details and Examples:

Code: 

# This is a comment.
# The purpose of this code is to demonstrate
# how to solve a system of linear equations
# using the AztecOO solver in Trilinos.

# Step 1. Include the necessary headers.
#include "AztecOO.h"
#include "Epetra_Map.h"
#include "Epetra_Vector.h"
#include "Epetra_CrsMatrix.h"
#include "Epetra_FEVector.h"

# Step 2. Set up the map.
Epetra_SerialComm Comm;
Epetra_Map Map(10, 0, Comm);

# Step 3. Create the vectors.
Epetra_Vector b(Map);
Epetra_Vector x(Map);

# Step 4. Set up the matrix.
Epetra_CrsMatrix A(Copy, Map, 3);
A(0,0) = 4;
A(0,1) = -1;
A(0,2) = -1;
A(1,0) = -1;
A(1,1) = 4;
A(1,2) = -1;
# Continue in this way for all matrix elements...
A.FillComplete();

# Step 5. Set up the solver.
AztecOO Solver(A, &x, &b);

# Step 6. Solve the system.
Solver.Iterate(1000, 1e-10);

These input files are in standard text format. The format required is either .cpp or .h for the program files, and the data files can be in a range of formats such as .txt and .dat.

This script does not require any specific instructions as such but you may need to set up Epetra and AztecOO within Trilinos and link these to your program.

Command to run: 

Use the `c++` compiler to compile the code, and then execute the object file. 
```shell
c++ -o solve system solve_system.cpp 
.\solve_system
```
