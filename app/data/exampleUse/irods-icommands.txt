Use Case: Managing data on an iRODS server using iRODS iCommands.

Code details and examples:
- iCommands allow users to interact with iRODS (Integrated Rule-Oriented Data System) for data management tasks such as uploading, downloading, moving, and manipulating files.

Sample command to list files in an iRODS collection:
```
ils
```

Sample command to upload a file to iRODS:
```
iput example.txt /irods_path/example.txt
```

Sample command to download a file from iRODS:
```
iget /irods_path/example.txt example.txt
```

These commands can be run in the terminal after setting up the iRODS environment and configuring the iRODS server connection.
