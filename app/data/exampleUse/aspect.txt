Use Case: The Aspect library in deal.II is used for complex simulations in the computational science, such as geodynamic simulations. Deal.II is a library written in C++.

Code details and examples: Code

Input File Format: 

Input file is a plain text file with ".prm" extension.

Example input file (named "input.prm"):

```
# Test input file for Aspect
subsection Initial temperature model
  set Model name = function
  subsection Function
    set Function expression = 273
  end
end
```

Code Snippet: 

To use the Aspect library in your deal.II, first, you need to instantiate an object of the Simulator class.

```C++
#include "aspect/simulator.h"

Aspect::Simulator<2> simulator(MPI_COMM_WORLD);
```
You need to initialize the simulator object before using it.
```C++
simulator.initialize("input.prm");
```
And finally, run the simulator 
```C++
simulator.run();
```

This completes a full Aspect use-case within a deal.II application.

Command to run:
```
mpirun -np 4 ./aspect input.prm
```
where `-np 4` is the number of processes (could be changed according to the availability of computational resources), `./aspect` is the path to the executable, and `input.prm` is the name of the input file.
