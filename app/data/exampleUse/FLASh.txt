Use Case: Use FLASh (Fast Length Adjustment of SHort reads) to merge overlapping paired-end reads from next-generation sequencing experiments into a single, longer sequence. 

Code details and examples:

Code: 

Input file: Paired-end reads in FastQ format

For instance, if you have two paired-end read files: reads1.fastq and reads2.fastq

The format required in these .fastq files is 4 lines per sequence:

```
@SEQ_ID
GATTTGGGGTTCAAAGCAGTATCGATCAAATAGTAAATCCATTTGTTCAACTCACAGTTT
+
!''*((((***+))%%%++)(%%%%).1***-+*''))**55CCF>>>>>>CCCCCCC65
```

1st line begins with a '@' character and is followed by the sequence identifier and an optional description (like a FASTA title line).
2nd line is the raw sequence letters.
3rd line begins with a '+' character and is optionally followed by the same sequence identifier (and any description) again.
4th line encodes the quality values for the sequence in line 2, and must contain the same number of symbols as letters in the sequence.

Command to run:

```
flash reads1.fastq reads2.fastq
```

This will produce three output files: out.extendedFrags.fastq, out.notCombined_1.fastq, and out.notCombined_2.fastq.

The 'out.extendedFrags.fastq' contains the merged paired-end reads, 'out.notCombined_1.fastq' and 'out.notCombined_2.fastq' contain the reads that were not able to merge.
