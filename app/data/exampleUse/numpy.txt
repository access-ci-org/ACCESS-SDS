Use Case: Used for numerical computations, it is a library for the Python programming language, adding multifaceted array object, matrices, along with an enormous library of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.

Code details and examples: 

Code:
```python
import numpy as np 

# Sample Input - Arrays
array_1 = np.array([1, 2, 3]) 
print("1D array: ", array_1) 

# Sample Input - Matrices
matrix_1 = np.array([[1, 2, 3],[4, 5, 6]]) 
print("\n2D matrix: ", matrix_1)

# Sample mathematical operation
result = np.add(array_1, matrix_1)
print("\nResult of addition: ", result)
```

Command to run:

python filename.py

Note: filename.py is the name of the file where this code has been written. Replace filename with the actual file name. 

Required Input file format: No specific input file requirement for numpy, it works with the numerical data provided within the code.

Specification in Input Files: N/A
