Code:

AWS CLI is a powerful command line interface which is used to interact with AWS services. Here's an example of the commands to upload files to Amazon S3.

Input files: Any files or folders to be uploaded to S3.

Format required: No specific format is required.

Example:

```bash
aws s3 cp myfolder s3://mybucket/myfolder --recursive
```

The `cp` command is used to upload files and folders to S3. The `--recursive` flag allows the command to navigate through all subfolders within 'myfolder' and upload all files.

Specifications:

Note: The upload path is specified as s3://mybucket/myfolder . Here 'mybucket' is the name of the bucket you are uploading to, and 'myfolder' is an optional directory within the bucket where the files will be uploaded. 

Command to run: 

The command can be run from a terminal window.

```bash
aws s3 cp myfolder s3://mybucket/myfolder --recursive
```

Note: AWS CLI installation and appropriate credentials setup is necessary to run this command.
