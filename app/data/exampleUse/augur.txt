Use Case: Use augur to infer phylogenetic trees from sequence data;

Code details and examples: Code

The augur software is written in Python and is designed to work with Fasta sequence files and CSV metadata files. To use augur, you need to have a sequence alignment in a Fasta file and some associated metadata, like sample dates, in a CSV file. 

1. Sample Input Files:

The sequence Fasta file should be in this format:

```
>Sequence1
ATGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGC
>Sequence2
ATGCTAGCTAGCTGGCTAGCTAGC
```

The CSV file should be in this format:

```
strain, date
Sequence1, 2020-01-01
Sequence2, 2020-02-01
```

2. Key Commands:

To build a tree using augur, you would first align your sequences with the `augur align` command:

```
augur align --sequences sequences.fasta --output sequences_aligned.fasta
```

Once aligned, you can build a preliminary tree using the `augur tree` command:

```
augur tree --alignment sequences_aligned.fasta --output tree.nwk
```

Then finally refine the tree including temporal information using `augur refine`:

```
augur refine --tree tree.nwk --metadata metadata.csv --output tree_time_resolved.nwk
```

Note: Above commands and files are just samples and can vary based on the actual data and requirements.
