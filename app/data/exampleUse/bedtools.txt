Use Case: bedtools is a genome arithmetic toolset that allows users to perform manipulations on genomic data, such as intersecting, merging, counting, complementing, and making histograms.

Code details and examples:

Code:
```
bedtools intersect -a file1.bed -b file2.bed > output.bed
```
The above command uses the `intersect` function of bedtools to find overlapping regions of genomic data between file1.bed and file2.bed. The output of this operation is saved in output.bed. 

Input File Format:
The input files for bedtools are often in BED (Browser Extensible Data) Format. A typical BED file contains several lines, where each line in the file corresponds to a different genomic region. Fields in the BED file are separated by whitespace (tabs are recommended). The first three fields are required and must be provided in the order shown below:
```
chrom - name of the chromosome or scaffold. 
chromStart - start position of the feature in the chromosome or scaffold. The first base in a chromosome is numbered 0.
chromEnd - end position of the feature in the chromosome or scaffold. The chromEnd base is not included in the display of the feature.
```

A sample input (`file1.bed`) could look like this: 
```
chr1    100    200
chr1    150    250
```
And `file2.bed` could be:
```
chr1    120    220
chr1    180    280
```

The output file after running the intersect operation will be: 
```
chr1    120    200
chr1    180    250
```
which are the overlapping regions between file1.bed and file2.bed.
