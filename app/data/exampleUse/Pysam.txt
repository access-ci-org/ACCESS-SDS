Use Case: Pysam is a python library for reading, manipulating and writing genetic data sets. Pysam is a wrapper of the htslib C-API and provides facilities to read and write SAM/BAM/VCF/BCF and GFF/GTF/FASTA variant files as well as access to the command line functionality of the SAMtools package.

Code details and examples:

Code:

```python
import pysam

# Open a BAM file
samfile = pysam.AlignmentFile("/path/to/my.bam", "rb")

# Fetch a region from the BAM file
for read in samfile.fetch('chr1', 10, 102100):
    print(read)

samfile.close()
```

Input file: The above code snippet requires a BAM format file as input. BAM is a binary format for storing sequence data.

File format: The alignment file my.bam has to be in BAM format. More details on the format are available on the SAMtools website.

No explicit specifications are needed for the input files apart from them being in the correctly formatted BAM file.

Command to run: If the python script is saved as script.py, it can be run using the command:
```bash
python script.py
```
