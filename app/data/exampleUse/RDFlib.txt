Use Case: RDFlib is a Python library used for working with RDF, a simple yet powerful language for representing information.The library contains parsers and serializers for RDF/XML, N3, NTriples, Turtle, TriX, and RDFa. RDFlib is also a platform for RDF Applications with SPARQL and Graph Database.

Code Details and Examples:

Code:

```python
from rdflib import Graph, Namespace, URIRef, Literal

# initialize a graph
g = Graph()

# create a namespace
n = Namespace("http://example.org/people/")

# bind the namespace to a prefix
g.bind("ppl", n)

# create triple
g.add((n.john, n.hasAge, Literal(42)))

# save the graph
g.serialize("example.rdf")
```

This code creates a simple RDF graph with a single triple saying that "John has an age of 42". The graph is saved as an rdf file.

Command to run:
`python3 filename.py`

*Please replace filename.py with the actual filename of your python file.*
