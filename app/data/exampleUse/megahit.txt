Code:
No detailed code is revealed to the user. Megahit is a standalone software package written in C++. The user interacts with it through the command line, using commands and parameters to specify input files and adjust settings. The above command initiates Megahit with default settings on your input files. You can also add additional parameters to customize the assembly process.
