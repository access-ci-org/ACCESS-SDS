Use Case: The PASA (Program to Assemble Spliced Alignments) pipeline is designed to analyze the alignment of transcript sequences (ESTs, cDNAs, and sequencing reads) to a genome to identify stretches of the genome that are transcribed (gene structures).

Code Details and Examples:

Code:

The key input files for a PASA run include:

1. Genome sequence file:
Format: Multi-FASTA
Filename: genome.fasta

2. Transcript alignment file:
Format: GTF 
Filename: transcript.gtf

A functioning example of code might look like:
```bash
/opt/PASApipeline/scripts/Launch_PASA_pipeline.pl -c alignAssembly.config -C -R -g genome.fasta -t transcript.gtf --ALIGNERS blat,gmap
```
In the `alignAssembly.config` file, required specifications would include the SQL database name and server. For example:
```
DATABASE=pasa_db
...
#Server details
server=mysql_server
user=db_user
password=db_password
...
```
