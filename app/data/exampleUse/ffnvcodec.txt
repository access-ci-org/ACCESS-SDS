Use Case: FFmpeg is a collection of libraries and tools that can decode, encode, transcode, multiplex, and demultiplex video and audio content. It can be used to support hardware acceleration. FFNV_CODEC is a part of FFmpeg which provides headers defining structures and function prototypes needed by the NVIDIA hardware accelerated codecs. A major use case is when you want to transcode a video file to a different format, applying filters or changing its properties such as resolution, framerate and more. 

Code details and examples: 

Code: 
The following FFmpeg command uses the FFNV_CODEC to hardware-accelerate a H.264 video encoding. 

```bash
ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c:v h264_nvenc -profile:v high -preset:v fast output.mp4
```

Input requirements and specifications:
The above command takes an MP4 video file as input (input.mp4) and generates an output file (output.mp4) encoded using the h264_nvenc codec.

For using FFNV_CODEC, the system needs to have the compatible NVIDIA Video Codec SDK installed. There are specific version requirements depending on the codec to be used. 

It involves the following:

- `-i input.mp4` specifies the input file. It must be a valid video file that FFmpeg can decode.
- `-c:v h264_nvenc` specifies the video codec to use for the output file, in this case, h264_nvenc which is a H.264 codec provided by NVENC (NVIDIA's hardware video encoder).
- `-profile:v high -preset:v fast` specifies the profile and preset for the video encoding process. The 'high' profile provides a higher quality output video, and the 'fast' preset speeds up the encoding process.

The command to run this specific Use Case:

```bash
ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c:v h264_nvenc -profile:v high -preset:v fast output.mp4
```
