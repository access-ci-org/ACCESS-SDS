Use Case: Hashdeep is a cross-platform software tool used for computing, matching, and auditing hashsets of any size. It is used in forensic investigations, system audits, and file integrity monitoring. Hashdeep's input file consists of a list of file names that you want to check the hashes of. The input file is typically a simple TXT file each line of which contains the full path to a file to be hashed. 

Code details and examples: Code 

To create a hashset for all files in a directory:

```bash
hashdeep -r /path/to/directory > hashset.txt
```

hashset.txt file will contain lines structured in the following way:

```bash
%%%% HASHDEEP-1.0
%%%% size,md5,sha256,filename
## Invoked from: /home/user
## $ hashdeep -r /path/to/directory
##

```

Where columns indicate the following: 
- file size in bytes
- md5 hash of the file
- sha256 hash of the file
- full path to the file

To audit a hashset:

```bash
hashdeep -r -k hashset.txt /path/to/directory 
```

This command will compare the current state of /path/to/directory with the previously created hashset and report any changes.
