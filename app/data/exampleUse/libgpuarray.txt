Use Case: libgpuarray enables computations on graphics processing unit (GPU) hardware by providing an abstraction layer that hides the details of the specific GPU hardware and software from the developer. It allows computations to be carried out on the GPU while only requiring knowledge of C programming language. It is useful in Machine Learning, scientific computations and image processing.

Code details and examples:

Code: 

The main structure in libgpuarray is the GpuArray. Here is an example of how to create a GpuArray:

```c
#include <gpuarray/array.h>
#include <gpuarray/error.h>

void * ctx = gpucontext_properties(gpuarray_buffer_cuda, 0, NULL, 0); //Get CUDA GPU context
GpuArray A;
size_t dims[2] = {1024, 1024};

int err = GpuArray_empty(&A, ctx, GA_FLOAT, 2, dims, GA_C_ORDER);
if (err != GA_NO_ERROR) {
  printf("Error in GpuArray creation: %s\n", gpucontext_error(ctx, err));
}
```

This code creates an empty GpuArray A of size 1024x1024 with elements of type float. The context ctx specifies which GPU to use and in this case, we are using a CUDA GPU. The storage order of the elements is in C order.

To compile this code, `gcc` can be used as follows:

```
gcc -o test test.c -lgpuarray -I/usr/include -L/usr/lib
```

This links the libgpuarray library and includes the required headers.

Note that `gcc` may need to be replaced with `nvcc` if the CUDA Toolkit is used.

The compiled program `test` can be run with 

```
./test
``` 

As no input file is needed in this example, there is no format for the input file. The code snippets mentioned above can be executed directly in the compiled script file.
