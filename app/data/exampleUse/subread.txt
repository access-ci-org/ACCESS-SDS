Use Case: The Subread software package is often utilized for the analysis of next-generation sequencing data, including both RNA-seq and DNA-seq data. This package has capabilities that range from read alignment and quantification to variant calling and mutation discovery.

Code Details and Examples:

For instance, one common utility of the Subread package is to align RNA-seq reads to a reference genome using its fast and accurate read aligner, Subjunc. 

Code:

Assuming you have a reference genome (in FASTA format, e.g., "genome.fa") and your RNA-seq reads (in FASTQ format, e.g., "reads.fq"), the command to perform the alignment would be:

```
subjunc -i genome.fa -r reads.fq -o output.bam
```

Here "-i" will specify the input reference genome file, "-r" is for the input reads and "-o" is for the name of the output BAM file in which the alignment results will be stored.

For mutation discovery, featureCounts, another tool in the Subread package, can be used. If you have an alignment results file (in BAM format) and a file annotating genomic features (in GTF format, e.g., "genes.gtf"), the command line would be like:

```
featureCounts -a genes.gtf -o count.txt aligned.bam
```

Here "-a" will specify the genomic feature file (GTF format), "-o" will be the output file storing the read count results per gene, and at the end, there is the input alignment results file.

Please note that the above commands are just examples. Always refer to the manual of Subread for the complete list of options and their usage.
