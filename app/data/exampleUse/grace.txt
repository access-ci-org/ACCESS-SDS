Use Case: Grace is a powerful 2D plotting tool that allows users to graphically represent numerical data. It is particularly useful in scientific research for creating plots of simulated or experimental data.

Code details and examples: Code

To use Grace, you will typically have to create an ASCII data file with two columns: one for the x-axis data and another for the y-axis data. For example, a sample data file (data.txt) might look like this:

```
1 2
2 3
3 4
4 5
```

You can load this data into Grace using its GUI, but it also supports command line interface. Here is a basic command to create a graph from this data:

```bash
xmgrace data.txt
```

This will create a basic graph with your data. Grace also supports a variety of other commands to customize your graph. For example:

```bash
xmgrace -pexec "s0 line color 2" data.txt
```

This will change the line color of the first dataset (s0) to be color index 2.

You can also use Grace's batch processing feature to create scripts for generating multiple graphs. Here's an example of what a batch file (script.bfile) might look like:

```bash
READ NXY "data.txt"
s0 line linestyle 1
s0 line linewidth 1.5
s0 line color 2
s0 symbol 1
s0 symbol size 0.6
s0 symbol color 2
s0 symbol fill color 2
s0 symbol fill pattern 1
PRINT TO "plot.ps"
DEVICE "EPS" LANDSCAPE
PRINT
```

To run this, you would use the -batch flag:

```bash
xmgrace -batch script.bfile -nosafe
```

This creates a plot based on "data.txt", customizes the style, then prints the result to "plot.ps" in EPS format.
