Use Case: TAU (Tuning and Analysis Utilities) is used in performance evaluation of parallel programs written in Fortran, C, C++, Java, Python and more. It allows for profiling (both statistically and using dynamic runtime instrumentation) and tracing (event-based, control-flow, or dataflow). 

Code details and examples: 

Code: 

```C
#include <iostream>
#include "Profile/Profiler.h" // TAU's header file

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
    TAU_PROFILE("main()", " ", TAU_DEFAULT);
    TAU_PROFILE_TIMER(t1, "f1()", "", TAU_USER);
    TAU_PROFILE_START(t1);
    // Some computational work here
    TAU_PROFILE_STOP(t1);
    return 0;
}
```

In this code snippet, you may see that `TAU_PROFILE` and `TAU_PROFILE_TIMER` are used to denote sections of the code that you want to profile. You simply wrap the code that you want to profile with these macros.

Then you would compile your program with TAU's wrapper scripts (e.g., `tau_cxx.sh` instead of `g++` for C++). Consider you have stored above code in a file named `example.cpp`.

Command to run them:

```bash
tau_cxx.sh example.cpp -o example
./example
```

Then use `pprof` command to see the output of profiling. 

```bash
pprof
```

Input Files: No input files are needed for this example. The only requirement is to include TAU's header file and use the macros to specify which parts of the code to profile.
