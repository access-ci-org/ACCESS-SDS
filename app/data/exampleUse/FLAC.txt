Use Case: FLAC is a software package that performs explicit, two-dimensional, dynamic simulations for computational solid earth geophysics. It is typically used for modeling large strains in geologic material, such as might occur during an earthquake.

Code details and examples:

Code:

In FLAC, a typical input file (usually a .dat or .flac file) would contain the numerical parameters for the simulation, including grid size, time steps, and material properties. 

Sample FLAC input file format:

```
;---------------------------------------------
; FLAC GRID
; --------------------------------------------
GRID 100 100
; TIME STEPPING
DYNAMIC
TIME INCREMENT 0.001
; SET PROPERTIES
ZONE PROPERTY density=2.5 xperm=1e-10 yperm=1e-10
;---------------------------
; BOUNDARY CONDITIONS
; --------------------------
FIX VELOCITY
    ; set roller boundary at east and west
    ZONE FACE X 100
    VALUE VELOCITY-NORMAL 0
    ZONE FACE X 1
    VALUE VELOCITY-NORMAL 0

;---------------------------
; INITIAL CONDITIONS
; --------------------------
    ZONE INITIALIZE PRESSURE 101
    ZONE INITIALIZE VELOCITY-NORMAL 0
    ZONE INITIALIZE VELOCITY-SHEAR 0
;---------------------------
; MODEL CYCLE
; --------------------------
    CYCLE 50000
    HISTORY 'time' 'vert. displacement at base'
cancel last
plot
end
```

Command to run FLAC program (in a Bash shell):

```bash
/path/to/flac inputfile.dat
```

This would execute the FLAC program on the inputfile.dat. The path requires correct FLAC installation. The results of the simulation are usually written to a .his or .out file in the same directory as the input file.
