Use Case: The snp-dists software is an application that calculates pairwise SNP (Single Nucleotide Polymorphism) distance matrices from a multi-FASTA alignment file.

Code details and examples:

Code:

```bash
# Sample Input File:
# Your FASTA file should look something like this:
>sample1
ACTG
>sample2
ACCG

# Command to run:
snp-dists yourfastafile.fasta
```

Specifications and Details:
The input file for this software is a multiple sequence alignment in FASTA format. Each sequence in the file should have a unique identifier specified in the header line (the line that begins with a > symbol). In the FASTA file, sequences are expected to be of equal length. 

The output is a matrix of SNP distances in CSV format. Each row and column is labeled with a sequence identifier and the cells contain the SNP distance between the sequences.
