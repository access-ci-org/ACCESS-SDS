Use Case: Running MPI programs on HPC software.

Code Details and Examples: Code

TO run an MPI program, we usually need the following two files: a PY file and a SBC file.

Here is a sample MPI.py file (assuming we have numpy installed):

Code:
```python
from mpi4py import MPI
import numpy

def compute_average(arr):
    return numpy.average(arr)

def main():
    add_these_numbers = range(1000000)
    avg = compute_average(add_these_numbers)
    print('Average: ', avg)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This will compute the average of the numbers from 0 to 1 000 000 and print.

And here is the sbatch file needed to run this MPI program on a Slurm-based HPC cluster (named run_mpi_example.sbatch):

Code:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH --job-name=mpi_example      
#SBATCH --nodes=16                 
#SBATCH --time=00:20:00             
#SBATCH --partition=normal          
#SBATCH --output=mpi_example.%N.%j.out 
#SBATCH --error=mpi_example.%N.%j.err  

module load mpi4py/3.0.0
srun python MPI.py
```

To run this, we simply use the following command:
```bash
sbatch run_mpi_example.sbatch
```

Specifications for the sbatch file are as follows:

- #SBATCH --job-name: The name of your job. This name appears when you use the squeue command.
- #SBATCH --nodes: The number of nodes you require for your job.
- #SBATCH --time: The maximum runtime for your job in days-hrs:mins:secs
- #SBATCH --partition: The cluster/partition you wish to run your job on.
- #SBATCH --output: Here, you specify the location/name of the file the standard output of your job is written to.
- #SBATCH --error: Here, you specify the location/name of the file the standard error of your job is written too.

The 'module load mpi4py/3.0.0' command will depend on your HPC cluster and how you have mpi4py installed. It is needed to set up your environment properly.
The 'srun python MPI.py' command actually runs your python script. It's 'srun' because we're running this on a Slurm-based HPC cluster.

The input is taken from the range function inside the script. The output is written to the files specified in the sbatch file.
