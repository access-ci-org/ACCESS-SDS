Use Case: The Linux operating system is widely used in scientific computing due to its flexibility, powerful command-line interface, and open-source nature. Tasks that can be easily accomplished using Linux include file manipulation, data processing, and system management.

Code details and examples:

Code: 
```
# To list all files in a directory
ls 

# To print the working directory
pwd 

# To change directory
cd /path/to/directory 

# To create a directory
mkdir directory_name 

# To remove a file 
rm file_name 

# To pipe the output of one command as the input of another
command1 | command2 

# To run a Python script
python script.py 

# To compile a C program
gcc -o output_file source_file.c 

# To run the compiled C program
./output_file 
```

These commands are run in the terminal or shell of a Linux operating system. The input for them typically comes in the form of command-line arguments (such as the name of a file, a directory path, or the name of an output file), direct user input, or text or data files. For example, a Python script named script.py can be run using the command `python script.py`, where 'script.py' is the input to the command 'python'.
