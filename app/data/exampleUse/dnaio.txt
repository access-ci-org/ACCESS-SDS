Use Case: dnaio is used for reading and writing FASTQ and FASTA files. Useful for tasks related to genomics or bioinformatics where manipulation of these types of files is required.

Code Details and Examples: 

Input File: A FASTA file, example.fa with following content:

```
>SEQUENCE_1
ATGC
>SEQUENCE_2
AGCT
```

Code:

``` python
import dnaio
with dnaio.open('example.fa') as file:
    for record in file:
        print(record)
```

Command to run:

``` bash
python script.py
```

This will output:

```
SEQUENCE_1 ATGC
SEQUENCE_2 AGCT
```

The script will open the FASTA file and print each record. Each record is a tuple containing the sequence name and the actual sequence. The input file needs to be in FASTA format - a text-based format for representing either nucleotide sequences or peptide sequences, in which nucleotides or amino acids are represented using single-letter codes.
