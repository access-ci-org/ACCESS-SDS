Use Case: The Exiv2 utility is a C++ library and command line utility to manage image metadata. It provides fast and easy read and write access to the Exif, IPTC, and XMP metadata of images in various formats.

Code Details and Examples:

Code: 
The primary use of the Exiv2 command-line utility is to read and write Image metadata. Below is an example of how to read metadata:

```
exiv2 example.jpg
```
This command provides the output of available metadata within example.jpg image.

To add or modify metadata, exiv2 allows for changes through command line. Below is an example of how to write metadata:

```   
exiv2 -M"set Exif.Photo.DateTimeOriginal 2022:12:29 10:48:50" example.jpg
```
This command modifies or adds the DateTimeOriginal metadata value on example.jpg image.

The input file required is an image file (example.jpg in the cases above), and there are no specific details or specifications needed in this input file.

To see changes, you can then use the exiv2 command made earlier to view the metadata.
