Use Case: Use pyTables for reading and writing large HDF5 files, performing queries on the stored data, and in general, for high performance computing (HPC) tasks. 

Code Details and Examples: Code

Usually, you start by importing the necessary modules:

```python
import tables
import numpy as np
```

Then, define the hk5 file you will work on:

```python
h5file = tables.open_file('tutorial1.h5', mode='w', title="Test file")
```

Next, define a group of data:

```python
group = h5file.create_group("/", 'detector', 'Detector information')
```

Define a table within the group, with the structure you want:

```python
from tables import IsDescription, StringCol, Int32Col
class Particle(IsDescription):
     name  = StringCol(16)
     idnumber = Int32Col() 
```

To initialize a table, you do so:

```python
table = h5file.create_table(group, 'readout', Particle, "Readout example")
```

To fill the table with data, we use a particle instance:

```python
particle = table.row
for i in range(10):
     particle['name']  = f'Particle_{i}'
     particle['idnumber'] = i
     particle.append()
```

To save the changes after populating data, we:

```python
table.flush()
```

You can run the program by calling the name of the Python file:

```bash
python3 your_file_name.py
```

Please remember to replace 'your_file_name.py' with the name of your Python file containing the code above.
