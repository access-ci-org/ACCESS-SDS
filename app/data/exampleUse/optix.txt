Use Case: 
OptiX is a programmable ray tracing framework for software developers to create applications that generate images by tracing rays through a 3D scene. It uses the GPU to enable speed and scalability and is used in fields such as visual effects, medical imaging, and autonomous cars.

Code Details and Examples: Code 

A simple example of an input file for OptiX is a scene description file, typically in a format such as.obj. The file consists of vertices for 3D models in the scene.

Here is a basic .obj file for a single triangle:

```
v 0.0 0.0 0.0
v 1.0 0.0 0.0
v 0.0 1.0 0.0
f 1 2 3
```

This file describes a scene with three vertices and one face. Each vertex has an (x, y, z) coordinate, and the face (f) is defined by the indices of the vertices.

Here is a sample OptiX code that loads this .obj file scene and renders it:

```C++
#include <optix.h>
#include <optix_world.h>

using namespace optix;

// Scene parameters
rtDeclareVariable(float3, eye, , );
rtDeclareVariable(float3, U, , );
rtDeclareVariable(float3, V, , );
rtDeclareVariable(float3, W, , );

rtBuffer<float3> vertex_buffer;
rtBuffer<int3> index_buffer;

RT_PROGRAM void pinhole_camera()
{
  size_t2 screen = output_buffer.size();
  float2 d = make_float2(launch_index) / make_float2(screen) * 2.f - 1.f;
  float3 ray_origin = eye;
  float3 ray_direction = normalize(d.x*U + d.y*V + W);

  optix::Ray ray(ray_origin, ray_direction, 0, 1e-3f, RT_DEFAULT_MAX);
  PerRayData_radiance prd;
  prd.result = make_float3(0.0f);
  rtTrace(top_object, ray, prd);
}
```

In this code, `pinhole_camera()` is the RT_PROGRAM that generates a simple camera model. The `rtTrace` function is called to start the ray tracing.

The command to run the OptiX rendering is program-specific but typically involves compiling the OptiX program into a binary and executing it with the scene file as an argument. This might look something like:

`./optixProgram scene.obj`

The exact command may vary depending on the application configuration and the setup of the OptiX SDK. It should be provided in the application documentation.
