Use Case: The R package BH provides access to functions and classes from the Boost library. It represents a set of peer-reviewed, free, open-source C++ libraries used by millions. It is great for implementing data analysis algorithms due to its computational speed.

Code details and examples: 

Code:

```
# Include the BH package in your R environment
library(BH)

# An operation that uses a boost function (e.g., boost::math::tgamma())
# to compute the gamma function value of a given vector v
v <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
gamma_values <- sapply(v, function(x) boost::math::tgamma(x))

# print the gamma function values
print(gamma_values)
```

Input File Specifications:

The BH package doesn't often work directly on input files, as it is a header-only library that provides utility functions for the R environment.

Command to Run Code:

In order to run the R script, navigate to the folder wherein your R script is located, call the Rscript interpreter and feed the script file into it. Assuming your R script file is named as 'myscript.R', the command would be:

```bash
Rscript myscript.R
```
