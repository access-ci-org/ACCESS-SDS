Use Case: Use Miniprot for protein sequence data management and analysis.

Code details and examples: Code

Miniprot is a Python library, it helps in handling protein sequence data. It can encode protein sequences to numeric arrays, handle protein sequence data sets, and perform various operations on the protein level.

Sample Input Files:
A text file containing protein sequences, each line in the file represents a different protein sequence.
Example:
ADFGT
GDKIFR

Specifications and Details in Input Files: 
The input files should contain protein sequences represented by the standard one-letter symbols. There should not be any spaces, tabs or special characters inside the sequence.

Code Snippet in Python to run it:

```python
from miniprot import Miniprot   # import the library

proteins = Miniprot.load('proteins.txt')  # load the protein sequences from file

for protein in proteins:  # iterate through the proteins
    print(protein.sequence)   # print the protein sequence
    print(protein.to_array()) # print the numeric representation of the protein sequence
```

Command to Run:
This being a Python script, it can be executed with the Python interpreter on your command line:
```bash
python your_script.py
```
Please replace "your_script.py" with the name of your Python file.
Remember, Python files should have the extension ".py". Be aware that the Python interpreter should be installed and correctly set in your system's PATH.
