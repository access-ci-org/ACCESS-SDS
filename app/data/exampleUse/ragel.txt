Use Case: Use Ragel to compile finite state machines into executable C or C++ code for fast and robust pattern matching in text processing applications.

Code details and examples: Code 
Ragel takes as input a .rl file describing the finite state machine. The machine specifies a set of possible states, the events that trigger transitions between states, and the actions that are taken as a result of these transitions.

Sample '.rl' file

```
%%{
  machine lexer;

  space     = ' ' | '\t';
  newline   = '\n';
  punctuation = ',' | '.' ;
  word      = (any - space - newline - punctuation)+;
  token     = space | newline | word | punctuation;
  main := |* token *|;
}%%
```
In this sample, a machine (lexer) is defined. 
- 'space' includes space or tab characters, 
- 'newline' is represented by the newline character,
- 'word' includes any character not included in 'space', 'newline' or 'punctuation',
- 'punctuation' includes either a comma or a period,
- 'token' can be either a 'word', 'space', 'newline' or 'punctuation'.
- The main machine reads any number of tokens.

To generate the C code from the Ragel file:

`ragel -C lexer.rl`

This will create a C file `lexer.c` with the finite state machine encoded inside. To compile this C file, you would use your preferred C or C++ compiler (e.g., gcc).

`gcc lexer.c -o lexer`

This will create an executable called 'lexer' that you can run with your input file:

`./lexer < input.txt`
