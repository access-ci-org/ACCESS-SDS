Use Case: WebLogo is a sequence logo generator. Sequence logos are a graphical representation of an amino acid or nucleic acid multiple sequence alignment.

Code Details and Examples: 

1. A simple example is given below:

Command to run:
```
weblogo < input.fa > output.eps
```

In this case, input.fa is a file with the following fasta format:
```
>Sequence1
AAAGGCTTTGACGTAGC
>Sequence2
AAAGGCTTTGACGTAGC
>Sequence3
AAAGGCTTTGACGTAGC
```

2. For more complex cases, you can provide additional options. The `-F` option selects the output format:

Input: same as above

Command to run:
```
weblogo -F pdf < input.fa > output.pdf
```

3. You can also specify the color scheme using the `--color` option:

Input: same as above
