Use Case: This is a Homo sapiens gene annotation package for the organism Homo sapiens (Human) used in the Bioconductor project that provides tools for the analysis and comprehension of high-throughput genomic data. This gene annotation package is used to annotate datasets, and further used for the analysis and comprehension of High-throughput Genomics Data. 

Code details and examples:

Code:
Package: org.Hs.eg.db
Type: Package
Title: Genome wide annotation for Human
Description: This package provides annotation data for the org.Hs.eg identifier class objects.
Version: 3.8.2

Command to load library and see some attributes.
```R
library(org.Hs.eg.db)

columns(org.Hs.eg.db)
```
Output:
$cdf
[1] "hgu133a"   "hgu133a2"  "hgu133b"   "hgu133plus2" .....

This provides the types of attributes that can be retrieved from org.Hs.eg.db

To retrieve specific gene information:
```R
select(org.Hs.eg.db, keys="7157", columns=c("SYMBOL", "GENENAME"), keytype="ENTREZID")
```
Output:
  ENTREZID SYMBOL                 GENENAME
1     7157  TP53 tumor protein p53

The `select` function retrieves attributes for a given set of key values (keys) for the given keytype. In the above command, it is using ENTREZID as keytype and retrieving SYMBOL and GENENAME as attributes.

The data for org.Hs.eg.db is typically accessed by using select and related functions from the AnnotationDbi package. The select function typically takes a three arguments: (1) the annotation package to use; (2) the keys (e.g.,eg: gene ids or symbols); (3) the columns to retrieve; and (4) the keytype, which tells select what type of keys your keys argument represents.
