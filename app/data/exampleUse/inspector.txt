Use Case: Use Intel Inspector to understand threading issues like deadlocks, race conditions, and memory issues like memory leaks. It helps improve the performance, correctness and reliability of applications in a C, C++, and Fortran environment.

Code details and examples: 

Code:
```c
// Test.c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main() {
    char* ptr = (char*)malloc(10);
    ptr[10] = 100;  // Out-of-bounds access
    return 0;
}
```
In the program above, there is a mistake where we try to access memory that is out of bounds. 

To run Intel Inspector, you need to first compile your application with debug info (which is usually a `-g` flag)

Command to compile:
```
gcc -g -o Test Test.c
```

Next, we can run Intel Inspector.

Command to run Intel Inspector:
```
inspxe-cl -collect mi3 -- Test
```
When the command execution is finished, Intel Inspector will output a list of memory and threading errors found in your application.
