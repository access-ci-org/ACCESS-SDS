Use Case: Adios2 is a data management system designed to support parallel, multi-step scientific simulations by providing flexible and efficient I/O systematically.

Code Details and Examples:

Suppose we have a data array "my_array" with dimensions 8 by 8.

Code:
```c++
#include <adios2.h>

int main()
{
    const size_t Nx = 8; 
    adios2::ADIOS myadios;         
    adios2::IO myio = myadios.DeclareIO("OutputIO");
    adios2::Engine myEngine = myio.Open("myData.bp", adios2::Mode::Write);
    myio.DefineVariable<int>("myArray", {Nx, Nx});
    std::complex<double> myArray[Nx][Nx]; 
    myEngine.BeginStep();
    myEngine.Put("myArray", myArray);
    myEngine.EndStep();
    myEngine.Close();
}
```
In the code above, we declare a data array "myArray".  We then write the data into "myData.bp" using the `Put` command. 

To compile and run the example in UNIX-like system, you may use the following commands:

Compile the program:
```
g++ -o write write.cpp
```
Run the program:
```
./write
```
The output will be stored in a binary file named "myData.bp". Please ensure that ADIOS2 is correctly installed and included in your path before running the program.
