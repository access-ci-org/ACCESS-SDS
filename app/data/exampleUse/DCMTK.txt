Use Case: DCMTK or DICOM Toolkit is a collection of libraries and applications implementing large parts the DICOM standard. It includes software for examining, constructing and converting DICOM image files, handling offline media, sending and receiving images over a network connection, as well as demonstrative image storage and worklist servers.

Code details and examples: 

Code:

The DCMTK software uses a command-line interface. For example, the dcm2xml application converts a DICOM file to its equivalent XML representation.

```
dcm2xml input.dcm output.xml
```

Input file: 

- Any DICOM file (example: input.dcm)
- Input file format: DICOM standard

Output file:

- XML file (example: output.xml)
- Output file format: XML

Specifications and details in input files: 

DICOM files include a header (containing the patient's demographic and examination information) and an image/binary data section. The header section contains several "tags," each associated with a specific piece of information. 

The dcm2xml command reads a DICOM file (input.dcm) and converts it to an XML file (output.xml). This output XML file can then be easily edited or viewed using standard XML tools.
