Use Case: Debugging code with Intel Debugger

Code details and examples:
Sample input file (sample.cpp):
```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    int a = 5;
    std::cout << "The value of a is: " << a << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

Command to compile with debug information using Intel Compiler:
```
icpc -g -o sample sample.cpp
```

Command to run the Intel Debugger (idb) on the compiled executable:
```
idb ./sample
```

Once inside the Intel Debugger, you can use commands like `break` to set breakpoints, `run` to start the program, `step` to step through the code, and `print` to print variable values while debugging.
