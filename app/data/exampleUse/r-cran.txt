Use Case: R-Cran is a collection of R packages for a wide variety of statistical and graphical techniques, including linear and nonlinear modeling, classical statistical tests, time-series analysis, classification, and clustering.

Code details and examples: Code

To use R-Cran, first load your data. This can be done using the `read.csv` function. For instance, if you have a CSV file named "data.csv", you can load it into a dataframe as follows:

```R
# Read data from CSV file
data <- read.csv("data.csv")
```
The CSV file should be in a standard format with each row as a record and each column as a field.

You can run statistical tests, such as a t-test, on your data:

```R
# Run a t-test on two groups in the data
t.test_result <- t.test(data$group1, data$group2)
```

In this case `group1` and `group2` would be the names of two columns in your dataframe representing the two groups you want to compare.

You can also fit models to your data, such as a linear model, as follows:
```R
# Fit a linear model to the data
linear_model <- lm(group1 ~ group2, data = data)

# Print the summary of the model
print(summary(linear_model))
```
In the above code, `group1 ~ group2` is the formula for your linear model where `group1` is the dependent variable and `group2` is the independent variable.

To run the script, save it as a `.R` file and then run the command `Rscript file.R` in the terminal, replacing `file.R` with the name of your script.
