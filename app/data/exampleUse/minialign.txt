Use Case: Minialign is commonly used in bioinformatics for high-speed alignment of long DNA sequences. Large sequencing data can be processed efficiently because of its high-speed algorithm. 

Code details and examples: 

Code:

The main command for running Minialign is:

`minialign -xont reads.fasta reference.fasta > align.sam`

Input Files:

1) `reads.fasta`: This is an input file containing DNA sequences that you wish to align. It needs to be in FASTA format. A sample FASTA file looks like:

```
>sequence1
ATGCGCTTGCT
>sequence2
AATAGCTAGCATCG
>sequence3
TTTATGCTAGCTG
```

2) `reference.fasta`: This is the reference genome (also in FASTA format) which the sequences will be aligned to. It may look something like:

```
>reference
TAATCGCTAGAGCTAATCGG
```

**Please note**: To run Minialign, the reference sequence and query sequences should be stored in the FASTA format.

Output: The output is written to the 'align.sam' file. SAM, which stands for Sequence Alignment/Map format, is a TAB-delimited text format consisting of a header section (which is optional) and an alignment section.
