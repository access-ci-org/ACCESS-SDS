Use Case: To compress a file system or a directory and preserve its structure and permissions.

Code details and examples: 

Code: 
A directory (say, ./example_dir) can be compressed into a squashfs file with the mksquashfs tool.

```bash
mksquashfs ./example_dir ./compressed_file.sqsh
```

This command will include all directories and files inside `./example_dir` into a single `compressed_file.sqsh` file.

Also, reading from a squashfs file can be done with unsquashfs tool:

```bash
unsquashfs ./compressed_file.sqsh
```

This will decompress all directories and files from `compressed_file.sqsh` to the current working directory. The command creates a squashfs-root directory that contains the filesystem contents.

For the `mksquashfs` command, the input file format is any valid directory/file system. For the `unsquashfs` command, the input file format is a valid squashfs file.

Input files should not have any specific requirements other than being a valid file system for mksquashfs and a valid squashfs file for unsquashfs. 

There are no specifications for the code or details in input files for mksquashfs or unsquashfs. The -noappend flag can be used for overwriting existing squashfs files rather than appending.
