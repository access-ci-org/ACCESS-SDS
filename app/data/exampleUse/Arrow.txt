Use Case: Arrow is a Python Library used for parsing, formatting, manipulating, and creating dates, times, and timestamps. It makes date and time manipulation easy and intuitive.

Code details and examples:

Code:
```python
import arrow

utc = arrow.utcnow()
utc
# Arrow(2013, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, tzinfo=tzutc())

utc = utc.shift(hours=-1)
utc
# Arrow(2013, 5, 4, 23, 0, 0, tzinfo=tzutc())

local = utc.to('US/Pacific')
local
# Arrow(2013, 5, 4, 16, 0, 0, tzinfo=tzfile('/usr/share/zoneinfo/US/Pacific'))

arrow.get('2013-05-05T12:30:45.123456789Z')
# Arrow(2013, 5, 5, 12, 30, 45, 123456, tzinfo=tzutc())
```
The `arrow.get()` function can parse a string representation of a date and time. This string could have been created by another process and saved in a database or file. The string format is 'YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.MMMMMM'.

The `arrow.utcnow()` function returns the current date and time in UTC. 

The `utc.shift(hours=-1)` function subtracts one hour from the time. 

The `utc.to('US/Pacific')` function converts the time to the 'US/Pacific' timezone. 

Command to run python code:
If your python file is named `example.py`, you can run in the command prompt or terminal:
```bash
python example.py
```
