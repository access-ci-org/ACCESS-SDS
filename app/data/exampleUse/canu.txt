Use Case: Canu is a popular bioinformatics tool that specializes in high-noise single-molecule sequencing (such as from Pacific Biosciences and Oxford Nanopore). With the use of a hierarchical assembly process, Canu can correct sequence errors, trim reads, and then assemble those pieces back together.  

Code details and examples: 

Input files: Canu necessitates sequence data in fasta or fastq format. Compressed files are acceptable as well. The tool will automatically figure out which kind of data it is dealing with based on the file extensions. The typical input file might be a fastq file from a sequencing machine such as Illumina MiSeq, and it would comprise of numerous sequencing reads, each with a unique identifier, sequence, and quality scores. 

Example of the sequence in a fastq file:

    @SEQ_ID
    GATTTGGGGTTCAAAGCAGTATCGATCAAATAGTAAATCCATTTGTTCAACTCACAGTTT
    +
    !''*((((***+))%%%++)(%%%%).1***-+*''))**55CCF>>>>>>CCCCCCC65

Command to run Canu:

(canu -p ecoli -d ecoli-auto genomeSize=4.8m -pacbio-raw pacbio.fastq) or (canu -p ecoli -d ecoli-auto genomeSize=4.8m -nanopore-raw nanopore.fastq)

Here, 'ecoli' signifies the assembly prefix which the output files will contain it. The 'ecoli-auto' is the directory for Canu to store the output files. Also, the ‘genomeSize’ is to specify the estimated genome size. The last part, either '-pacbio-raw' or '-nanopore-raw', is the command to define the specified sequencing data (either from the Pacific Biosciences or Oxford Nanopore technology) and its subsequent fastq file.

Note: Canu will auto-detect available resources and configure itself to optimally run based on the resources of the system on which it is being run. For manual configuration, users can further specify their computing setup information.
