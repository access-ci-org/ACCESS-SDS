Use Case: Use PyTorch for deep learning processes, creating computational graphs, and running on the GPU.

Code details and examples: Code

PyTorch operates under a dynamic computation graph model, which means that the graph will create on the fly as the operations occur in contrast to other deep learning frameworks -where an ahead-of-time computation graph is created.

Here is an example of a simple matrix multiplication using PyTorch:

```python
import torch

# Create tensor
tensor1 = torch.tensor([[1, 2,], [3, 4.]])
tensor2 = torch.tensor([[5, 6,], [7, 8.]])

# Multiply tensors
result = torch.matmul(tensor1, tensor2)
print(result)
```

This would output:

```
tensor([[19., 22.],
        [43., 50.]])
```

Running a simple linear regression model:
```python
import torch
from torch import nn

# Here is some artificial data
x = torch.tensor([1, 2, 3, 4], dtype=torch.float32)
y = torch.tensor([2, 4, 6, 8], dtype=torch.float32)

# We need to create a model
model = nn.Linear(1, 1)

# Here is our training loop
for epoch in range(10):
    # Forward pass
    y_pred = model(x)

    # Loss calculation
    loss = (y_pred - y**2).mean()

    # Backward pass
    loss.backward()

    # Update weights using gradient descent
    with torch.no_grad():
        for p in model.parameters():
            p -= p.grad
    model.zero_grad()

print(f'Prediction after training: {model(x).detach().numpy()}')
```
Predictions will be printed at the end.

With PyTorch, you have the flexibility to design your computation graph during runtime, and this is why PyTorch is more pythonic than other frameworks.
