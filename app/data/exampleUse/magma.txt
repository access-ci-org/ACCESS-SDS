Use Case: Solving large scale linear algebra problems.

Code details and examples: 

Code:
Magma is used to solve linear algebra problems effectively using the GPUs. The inputs are usually large matrices. 

Example: Solving a system of linear equations AX = B using Magma

Input File Format:
The input file should contain your matrix A and B. These can be stored in plain text file format. Each line corresponds to a row of the matrix, with the values in the row separated by spaces.

Suppose we have a 2x2 matrix A = [1, 2; 3, 4] and a 2x1 vector B = [5; 6] to represent the system of linear equations:

1*x1 + 2*x2 = 5
3*x1 + 4*x2 = 6 

Sample Input File:

For Matrix A:
1 2
3 4  

For Vector B:
5
6

Code Snippet:

In MAGMA, we first need to initialize the MAGMA library with `magma_init()`, then we create the matrices and vectors.

```c
#include "magma_v2.h"

// create matrices
magma_d_matrix A={Magma_CSR}, B={Magma_CSR}, X={Magma_CSR};

// Read matrices A and B
magma_d_csr_mtx(&A, "A.txt");
magma_d_csr_mtx(&B, "B.txt");

// solve AX = B
magma_d_solver( A, B, &X, opts);

// Write the solution matrix X
magma_d_csr_mtx(&X, "X.txt");

magma_finalize(); // finalize the magma
```

Command to Run:

You compile the code using gcc and then run the executable. For example, if the file is named `solver.c`:

```shell
gcc -o solver solver.c -lmagma
./solver
```

In the file X.txt, you'll find the solution to your system of equations.
