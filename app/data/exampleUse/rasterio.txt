Use Case: Rasterio is used in geographical information systems for handling raster data. It could be employed for reading raster files, metadata and plotting raster files.

Code Details and Examples:
Code:

```python
import rasterio
from rasterio.plot import show

# Open the raster file
src = rasterio.open('example.tif')

# Print the metadata of the raster file
print(src.meta)

# Plot the raster file
show(src)
```

**Sample Input Files:** The expected input is a raster file, for example, a .tif file (example.tif).

**Input File Specifications:** Rasterio reads files with formats: GeoTIFF (.tif), Erdas Imagine Images (.img), and others. The file must be properly formatted, and the data inside should follow the GIS standards for raster data.

**Command Running:** Save the above code into a Python file, say `rasterio_example.py`, and run the python file using the command: `python rasterio_example.py`

**Code Explanation:** The code first imports the necessary module. It then opens the raster file with `rasterio.open()`. After that, the metadata of the raster file is printed using the `meta` property of a rasterio object. Finally, the raster file is plotted to visualize it.
