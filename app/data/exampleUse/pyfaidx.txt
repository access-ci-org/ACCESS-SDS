Use Case: Pyfaidx is a Python library used in bioinformatics for generating and retrieving slices of FASTA files. This library is designed to provide methods for indexing and extracting sequences and sub-sequences from FASTA files.

Code details and examples: Code

Indexing:

To index a file you can use the Fasta function.

```python
from pyfaidx import Fasta
genes = Fasta('genes.fasta')
```

Fetching Sequences:

To fetch the sequence of a gene you can use the following:

```python
seq = genes['gene_name']
print(seq)
```

Slicing:

If you want to slice a sequence of a gene you can use the following:

```python
seq_slice = genes['gene_name'][0:500]
print(seq_slice)
```

Subsequences:

To fetch subsequences you can use the following:

```python
sub_seq = genes['gene_name'][::-1]
print(sub_seq)
```

Though it isn't a command-line tool, Pyfaidx can be run as a command-line as follows:

Command to run: `python script.py` (Assuming the script file is script.py)

Input and Format: Pyfaidx requires an input file in FASTA format (`.fasta` file).

Details in Input Files: Input FASTA files should follow the standard format where each sequence is represented by two lines - one starting with '>' and the identifier of the sequence, the other with the sequence itself. For example:

```
>gene1
ATGCATGCATGCATGC
>gene2
TGCACTGCACTGCATG
```

This means that Pyfaidx is working with already-analyzed and segmented genome data, rather than a raw sequencer output.
