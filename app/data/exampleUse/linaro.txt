Use Case: Linaro is a software toolchain that is used for compiling source code of an application to run on certain hardware architecture. Generally used in embedded systems or ARM architecture applications development.

Code Details and Examples: 

Code:

Let's take an example of a simple C program 'hello.c'. The important input file is the source code, which in this case is the C file. 

```c
#include<stdio.h>

int main()
{
    printf("Hello World\n");
    return 0;
}
```
To compile and execute this code using Linaro toolchain, you would use the arm-linux-gnueabihf-gcc compiler which is part of the Linaro toolchain. The command for compilation would be

```
arm-linux-gnueabihf-gcc -o hello hello.c
```
In this, '-o hello' is used to specify the output file name. This will use the Linaro toolchain to compile the code to run on an ARM architecture.

If successful, this command produces an executable file 'hello', which can be run on an ARM device. To run the executable on the host machine, a simulator like 'qemu' is required. 

```
qemu-arm -L /usr/arm-linux-gnueabihf/ hello
```
This command will print "Hello World" on the console. '/usr/arm-linux-gnueabihf/' is the directory where the arm-linux-gnueabihf-gcc compiler is installed.

Please note that the exact paths and compiler versions might vary based on the specific setup and the code being compiled.
