Use Case: HEASOFT is a uniform, self-contained software for High Energy Astrophysics (X-ray and Gamma-Ray Astronomy). The tasks in this software package allows for the reduction and analysis of event data from uhuru, Einstein, EXOSAT, ROSAT, EUVE, ASCA, RXTE, XTE, XMM-Newton, and Chandra, as well as several sets of High Energy Astrophysics data, like WMAP.

Code details and examples:

1. Code to analyze data:

```bash
# Set the input and output FITS files
fitsinfile=Xadesvt.fits
fitsoutfile=srcimage.fits

# Run ximage to perform the imaging
ximage <<EOF
read/size=512 $fitsinfile
disp
scale log
save_image $fitsoutfile
exit
EOF
```

2. Code to detect sources:

```bash
# Set the input and output FITS files
fitsinfile=srcimage.fits
fitsoutfile=srclist.fits
thresh=3.e-3

# Run wavdetect to detect the sources
wavdetect infile=$fitsinfile outfile=$fitsoutfile scellfile=skycell.fits imagefile=sourceim.fits defnbkgfile=bkgmap.fits scales="1.0 2.0 4.0 6.0 8.0 12.0 16.0 24.0" clobber=yes threshold=$thresh
```

3. Code to extract spectra:

```bash
# Set the input and output FITS files
eventfile=events.fits
srcx=4146.5
srcy=4028.5
radius=47.5

# Run dmextract to extract the source spectra
dmextract "circular($srcx,$srcy,$radius)[$time=::1000]" spectrum.fits
```

4. Code to generate response files:

```bash
# Set the input and output FITS files
eventfile=events.fits
srcx=4146.5
srcy=4028.5
radius=47.5

# Run mkarf to generate the Ancillary Response File (ARF)
mkarf "circular($srcx,$srcy,$radius)[$time=::1000]" arf.fits
```

5. Code to fit a spectral model:

```bash
# Load the data
load_data('spectrum.fits')

# Load the ARF
load_arf('arf.fits')

# Define the model
set_source(powlaw1d.p1)

# Fit the model to the data
fit()

# Save the model parameters
save_model('model.fits')
```

Note:
- The above commands are to be executed on the bash (Unix shell) command line.
- Input and Output files are in FITS format
- The specifications in the input file contain information like time, spectral data, instrument response, etc. for X-ray and gamma-ray astronomical observation. The event data is a collection of photons, each with an energy, time, and a location in the sky. For a sky image, the input FITS file will contain these attributes for each photon, represented parent solar ray data.
- The source (srcx, srcy) are the coordinates of the src in the eventfile.
- The "powlaw1d.p1" in the "set source" command line is the model to fit the power-law to the source spectrum. It has a photon index and thereafter normalizes at 1 keV.
- The time specification [time=::1000] in the code is to select time ranges in units of seconds.
- The scales "1.0 2.0 4.0 6.0 8.0 12.0 16.0 24.0" are the wavelet scales to be used to detect sources for the wavdetect tool.
- The threshold (thresh) is for the detection algorithm. The value continues until there are no peaks above the threshold.

These are high-level examples and the details might differ depending on the actual dataset and the precise objective of the analysis.
