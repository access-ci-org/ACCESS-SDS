Use Case: OpenFOAM 
OpenFOAM is a popular open-source software aimed at numerical simulations in fluid dynamics. You can use OpenFOAM to simulate aerodynamics of a car, water flow in a pipe, shock waves, etc. It requires an input file containing the parameters of the simulation.

Code Details and Examples: Code
Input file example (system/controlDict):
```
application     pisoFoam;
startFrom       startTime;
startTime       0;
stopAt          endTime;
endTime         0.5;
deltaT          0.005;
writeControl    timeStep;
writeInterval   20;
purgeWrite      0;
writeFormat     binary;
writePrecision  6;
writeCompression compressed;
timeFormat      general;
timePrecision   6;
runTimeModifiable true;
```
Command to run: `pisoFoam`

Use Case: NumPy
NumPy is a Python library that provides a multidimensional array object, various derived objects, and an assortment of routines for fast operations on arrays, including mathematical, logical, shape manipulation, sorting, selecting, I/O, discrete Fourier transforms, basic linear algebra, and basic statistical operations, etc.

Code Details and Examples: Code
Python snippet using numpy:
```python
import numpy as np

# Create an array of ten zeros
a = np.zeros(10)

print(a)
```
Run with: `python script.py`

Use Case: GROMACS
GROMACS is a molecular dynamics package mainly designed for simulations of proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids. It requires an input file that contains the molecular coordinates and parameters for the simulation.

Code Details and Examples: Code
GROMACS input file example (topol.top):
```
