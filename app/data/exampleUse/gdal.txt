Use Case: Use GDAL to convert a GeoTIFF file to an ASCII grid.

Code details and examples:

Code:

```bash
gdal_translate -of AAIGrid source.tif output.asc
```

In this command, "source.tif" is a sample input file which should be a GeoTIFF file. The output will be an ASCII grid file named "output.asc". 

GDAL uses command-line arguments. Here, '-of AAIGrid' specifies the output format. 'source.tif' is the input file and 'output.asc' is the output file.

Input file (source.tif): A valid GeoTIFF file. 

Output file (output.asc): A valid ASCII grid file.

Specs: No particular specs required in the input file. But the input file should be in a format that GDAL can read, which includes a structured GeoTIFF file. The output format will be an ASCII grid.

Command to run: This command-line script can be run on a terminal.
