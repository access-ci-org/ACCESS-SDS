Use Case: ParaFold is used for predicting the secondary structure and thermodynamics of an RNA sequence.

Code details and examples: Code

ParaFold requires two input files: a sequence file and a base pair probability matrix file. 

Sequence File (seq.txt):
```
>Sequence1
AUGUAGCUAGUCUAGCGUACGUG
```
Base Pair Probability File (bpp.txt):
```
#i j        p(i,j)
1  5        0.0
1  6        0.00001
1  7        0.00005
2  8        0.00004
...
```
The first column represents the start of the base pair and the second column represents the end of it. The third column indicates the probability of the base pair occurring.

To run ParaFold with these input files, you would use the following command:
```bash
parafold seq.txt -p bpp.txt -o output.txt
```
This command outputs the predicted secondary structure and other thermodynamic properties to a file named output.txt. 

The output file may look something like this:
```
>Sequence1
Structure: 0.967 : ((.(((..((...))..))).))
Enthalpy: -22.6 kcal/mol
Free Energy: -8.43 kcal/mol
```
