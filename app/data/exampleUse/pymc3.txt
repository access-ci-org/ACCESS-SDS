Use Case: Creating a simple Bayesian model using pymc3 for a given dataset to discern the underlying distribution.

Code details and examples:

Code:
```python
import pymc3 as pm
import numpy as np

# Sample Data
np.random.seed(123)
n_experiments = 4
theta_real = 0.35  # unknown value in a real experiment
data = pm.Bernoulli.dist(p=theta_real).random(size=n_experiments)

# Bayesian Model
with pm.Model() as our_first_model:
    # a priori
    theta = pm.Beta('theta', alpha=1, beta=1)
    # likelihood
    y = pm.Bernoulli('y', p=theta, observed=data)
    start = pm.find_MAP()
    step = pm.Metropolis()
    trace = pm.sample(1000, step=step, start=start)
```

The input in this case is the 'data' array which is a Bernoulli distributed random variable with probability theta_real. The output is the Bayesian modelâ€™s estimation of the distribution of theta, the Bernoulli parameter.

The command used to run this Python file differs based on the environment:

If it's a Python script (let's say named script.py), you'd run it via a terminal as:
```bash
python script.py
```

If it's a Jupyter notebook cell, simply running the cell would execute it.
