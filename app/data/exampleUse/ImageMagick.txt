Use Case: ImageMagick is a software suite to create, edit, and compose bitmap images. It can read, convert and write images in a variety of formats (over 100) including DPX, EXR, GIF, JPEG, JPEG-2000, PDF, PhotoCD, PNG, Postscript, SVG, and TIFF. ImageMagick is used to translate, flip, mirror, rotate, scale, shear and transform images, adjust image colors, apply various special effects, or draw text, lines, polygons, ellipses and BÃ©zier curves.

Code details and examples: Code.

The program interface is primarily through command line commands. Here's a simple example:

Example: Convert an image from JPEG to PNG format

Command to use:
```
convert image.jpg image.png
```
The input file for this example is image.jpg and it is in JPEG format.

Example: Resize an image

Command to use:
```
convert -resize 50% image.jpg image_small.jpg
```
This command will resize the input file `image.jpg` to 50% of its original size and output the result to `image_small.jpg`.

Example: Combine multiple images into one

Command to use:
```
convert image1.jpg image2.jpg +append output.jpg
```
In this example, ImageMagick takes image1.jpg and image2.jpg as input, and combines them into one image (output.jpg) placed side by side. 

Important to note: In the input file, there are no particular restrictions other than it should be in a format recognizable by ImageMagick.

Make sure to replace `image.jpg`, `image.png` etc with your actual file paths.
