Use Case: Use TACC (Texas Advanced Computing Center) for running large-scale simulations, data processing and analysis tasks. It's typically used in High Performance Computing (HPC) environment.

Code details and examples:

TACC uses Slurm as their job scheduler. The input is usually a script that contains the job specifications and the command to execute the job, saved in a .sh file.

For instance, suppose you are running a Python script named "hello_world.py". 

Code:
```
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH --job-name=hello_world
#SBATCH --output=hello_world_out.txt
#SBATCH --error=hello_world_err.txt
#SBATCH --time=01:00:00
#SBATCH --partition=normal
#SBATCH --nodes=1
#SBATCH --ntasks=1

module load python3
python3 hello_world.py
```

This script will create a job named "hello_world", and it has specified output and error files "hello_world_out.txt" and "hello_world_err.txt". In the "module load" line, python3 is being loaded.

To run this script, use the command: `sbatch script.sh`

The Python script "hello_world.py" just contains a simple print statement: 
```
print('Hello,TACC!')
```
The job scheduler will take care of running your script across all the nodes/processors specified in the script. Enhancing parallelism, specifically for HPC, requires additional details including use of message passing interface (MPI) or parallel python libraries as per the use-case and complexity involved.
