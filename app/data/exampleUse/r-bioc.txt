Use Case: Use Bioconductor to analyze array data; extracting probe level data, normalizing the array and finally plotting and reordering the heatmap.

Code details and examples: 

Code: In R, the minimum required packages are hthgu133plus2cdf and affy. Therefore, the dataset we will use is a subset of the hthgu133plus2 data from GEO, curated by Edward Curry.

```R
# Load necessary libraries from Bioconductor
library(affy)
library(hthgu133plus2cdf)

# Load data
data = ReadAffy(celfile.path = "C:/path/input/dataset")

# Normalize the array data using RMA
data_rma = rma(data)

# Extract data for gene of interest
gene = data_rma$ENTREZID$EGFR

# Plot heatmap of the data
heatmap(as.matrix(gene), scale="row")
```

Input file format and details required: The input file format for most Bioconductor packages is generally raw microarray data files such as CEL files, which contain intensities for each probe on the array. A metadata file (.csv or .txt) describing the samples may also be required.

Command to run: After you have written and saved your script as a .R file, from the command line, navigate to the directory containing the script and use the following command to run the script:

```R
Rscript script_name.R
```

Note: Instead of the full directory path, relative paths can also be used in R if the working directory has been properly set.
