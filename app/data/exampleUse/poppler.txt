Use Case: Poppler is a PDF rendering library that is used for reading PDF files. It's often used within other PDF libraries and applications.

Code details and examples:
Code:

Poppler doesn't normally interact with command line. Instead, it's used within applications or other libraries, such as pdftotext. Here's an example of how you might use pdftotext (which includes Poppler) in bash to convert a PDF to text:

```bash
pdftotext input.pdf output.txt
```

Input Files: The input file is a PDF document.

Format Required: PDF (Portable Document Format)

Specifications: The input PDF file should be a valid format that can be opened and read without errors.

Note: Poppler doesn't usually provide error messages or issues to the user directly. Instead, any issues with the PDF would likely result in an error from the application using Poppler (like pdftotext). 

If using Poppler in a programming language (like Python), the code might look something like this:

```python
import pdftotext

# Load your PDF
with open("input.pdf", "rb") as f:
    pdf = pdftotext.PDF(f)

# If it's password-protected
with open("secure.pdf", "rb") as f:
    pdf = pdftotext.PDF(f, "secret")

# Save all text to a txt file.
with open('output.txt', 'w') as f:
    f.write("\n\n".join(pdf))
```

In the above Python code, it opens your PDF file, reads its content and writes the content to a .txt file. If your PDF file is password-protected, you need to enter the password as shown in the code.
