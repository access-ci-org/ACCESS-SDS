Use Case: Use of the xdresourceid package for identifier resolution in the context of heterogeneous data sources in Python.

Code details and examples: Code:
```python
import xdresourceid

# Create a resolver for DOIs
resolver = xdresourceid.get_resolver('doi')

# Get a resource
resource = resolver.get('10.1234/foo')

# Use the resource
print(resource.url)
print(resource.content)
```
On usage of the above code, `xdresourceid` library is imported and `get_resolver` method is called with 'doi' as argument to create a resolver for DOI (Digital Object Identifiers). To fetch a resource corresponding to a DOI identifier the `get` method is called on the resolver object. It returns resource object related to the identifier public url and content are printed.
