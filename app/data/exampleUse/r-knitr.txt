Use Case: The knitr library in R is widely used for dynamic report generation in R. It enables the intermingling of code and text to create comprehensive reports. One common use case is to create a reproducible research document in which the data analysis code, results, and interpretation are all located in the same place.

Code details and examples: 

To use knitr, you first need to install it using `install.packages("knitr")` command in R. Once installed, you load knitr in a script with `library(knitr)`.

It's common to use knitr with Rmarkdown. Here's a simple example of this usage:

```
---
title: "Simple Knitr Document"
output: pdf_document
---

```{r}
# load in the data
data(mtcars)

# summarize the data
summary(mtcars)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap='A scatterplot.'}
# Plot data
plot(mtcars$mpg, mtcars$disp, xlab="mpg", ylab="disp")
```
```

The above code when saved in a .Rmd file and run using the `rmarkdown::render("filename.Rmd")` command in R or "Knit" button in RStudio, generates a PDF that includes both the code and its output.

The input format is a .R script or .Rmd file.

The specifications include:

- A YAML header surrounded by ---
- knitr code chunks surrounded by ```
- Code chunk options (e.g., echo=FALSE) directly after the `{r}`

Code snippets are included directly in the .Rmd file, and can be written as normally written in R. The output file (this case, a PDF) includes both the input code and the output it generates (both the console output and graphs).
