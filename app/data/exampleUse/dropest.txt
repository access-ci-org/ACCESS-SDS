Use Case: dropest is a bioinformatics package that is utilized for analyzing droplet-based single-cell RNA-seq data. The tool provides rates, biases correction among other outputs in relation to scRNA-seq data.

Code Details and Examples:
Code:

Your input file would be in BAM or SAM format. For this example, let's assume the file is called "input.bam".

Command to run dropest:

`dropest -m -g [gtf_file] input.bam`

This command will run dropest with the input file "input.bam" and a GTF file that specifies gene annotations.

The `-m` option tells dropest to calculate the statistics for the matrix, while the `-g` option is used to provide the path to your GTF file.

On completion, dropest will generate 'filtered.matrices.rds' output file. The file contains a list with E, D and W matrices and ERCC information. 

`readRDS("filtered.matrices.rds")`

It's important to note, the input BAM/SAM files should be aligned to your reference genome before running dropest. The files should also be sorted by cell and UMI barcodes incorporated in your read IDs. 

The GTF file should be the same reference file used for aligning your reads. It must be in GTF format and must match your reference genome.
