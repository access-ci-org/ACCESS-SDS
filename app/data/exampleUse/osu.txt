Use Case: OSU Micro-Benchmarks is a popular collection of benchmarks designed for testing MPI (Message Passing Interface) performance in multiple contexts. A user might want to compare the performance of different MPI implementations or tune a specific one to a particular kind of HPC hardware.

Code details and examples: Code

1. Sample Input File:

    OSU Micro-Benchmarks do not rely on any external input files. They control the parameters of the benchmarking from the command line.

2. Required File Format: 

    Not applicable.

3. Specifications and Details:

4. Command to Run Them

    Here is the command for compiling and running the osu_bw (bandwidth) benchmark:

    ```bash
    # Compile the benchmark
    make

    # Run the benchmark
    mpirun -np 2 ./osu_bw
    ```

    To run the benchmark with a different number of processes:

    ```bash
    mpirun -np 4 ./osu_bw
    ```

5. Code snippets: 

    The exact code is contained within the C files in the OSU Micro-Benchmarks distribution. The code is based around the MPI_Send and MPI_Recv functions, which send and receive messages between MPI processes. The size of the message sent is one of the critical parameters of the benchmark. 

    Here is a simplified code snippet that demonstrates the core of what the osu_bw benchmark is doing:

    ```c
    #include <mpi.h>

    int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
        int rank, size, i;
        char message[1024];

        MPI_Init(&argc, &argv);
        MPI_Comm_rank(MPI_COMM_WORLD, &rank);
        MPI_Comm_size(MPI_COMM_WORLD, &size);

        for (i = 0; i < 1000000; i++) {
            if (rank == 0) {
                MPI_Send(message, 1024, MPI_CHAR, 1, 0, MPI_COMM_WORLD);
            } else if (rank == 1) {
                MPI_Recv(message, 1024, MPI_CHAR, 0, 0, MPI_COMM_WORLD, MPI_STATUS_IGNORE);
            }
        }

        MPI_Finalize();

        return 0;
    }
    ```

    This code sends a message of a fixed size (1024 bytes) between two processes a million times. The OSU Micro-Benchmarks add robust error checking, performance timing, and command-line options for changing parameters like the message size.
