Use Case: Virtualenv is a tool used to create isolated Python environments. This is especially useful when different projects require different environments or dependencies. A project that needs Django 1.10 needs a different environment than a project that needs Django 1.8.

Code Details and Examples: 

Code :
```python
# Create a virtual environment
virtualenv new_environment

# Activate the virtual environment
source new_environment/bin/activate

# Verify you are in the correct environment
which python
# It should output something like this /path/to/new_environment/bin/python

# After work is done, you can exit the virtual environment
deactivate
```

There is no input file required for this. All commands are run in the command line terminal. The output changes according to the user-specific system and paths.
