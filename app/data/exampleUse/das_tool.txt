Use Case: DAS_Tool is used in metagenomics to robustly extract microbial genomes from metagenomic datasets. It integrates the results of a flexible number of binning algorithms and automatically determines the optimized parameter selection. It can calculate precision, recall, and optimized selection based on single copy genes.

Code details and examples:

Code:

First, run multiple binning algorithms on quality-filtered metagenomic contigs and save the binning results in files. Suppose we have bins generated from two different binners, metabat and maxbin respectively.

```
metabat_bins = /path/to/metabat/bins/directory
maxbin_bins = /path/to/maxbin/bins/directory
```

Next, run DAS Tool to combine and optimize bins from metabat and maxbin. We also need a contig coverage file, usually calculated during the assembly step.

```
contig_coverage = /path/to/contig/coverage.tsv
contig_fasta = /path/to/contig/sequence.fasta
```

The command to run DAS-Tool:

```
DAS_Tool -i $metabat_bins,$maxbin_bins -l metabat,maxbin -c $contig_fasta -d $contig_coverage -o das_output_directory
```

Specifications:

The input files required are:
1. Quality filtered metagenomic contigs generated by a binning algorithm. The file format is .fasta.
2. A tab-separated table with contigs in rows and samples in columns. Each cell in the table is the coverage of the contig in the corresponding sample.

The output file can be .fasta format (bins), .csv format (binning summary) and .pdf format (binning visualization).
