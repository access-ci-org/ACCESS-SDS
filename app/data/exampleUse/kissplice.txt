Use Case: KisSplice is a software that enables to analyse RNA-seq data with or without a reference genome. It is an application of de Bruijn graphs which can be used to identify polymorphisms (SNPs and Indels) without a reference genome.

Code details and examples: 

Code:

KisSplice uses FASTQ/FASTA files as input, which are commonly used to store raw sequence data.

Sample input file (`reads_1.fasta`):

```
>read1
AGCTTCGAGTGCCAGGACAGTCAG
>read2
CCTTCGATGAATAGGGCCTTCCAG
>read3
GCCAGAGTTTCCAGGCTTCGATGA
...
```

The command to run KisSplice is as follows:

```
kissplice -s 1 -k 41 -v --experimental -r reads_1.fasta -r reads_2.fasta
```

In this command, `-s` specifies the step to start from, `-k` specifies the size of the k-mers to use, `-v` runs KisSplice in verbose mode, `--experimental` enables experimental features, and `-r` flags are used to specify the input read files.
