Use Case: Graphviz is used for creating diagrams of abstract graphs and networks in a variety of formats. It is commonly used in areas like networking, bioinformatics, software engineering, database and web design.

Code Details and Examples:

Code: 

File Name - simple.dot

```
digraph G {
    A -> B;
    B -> C;
    C -> D;
    D -> A;
}
```
This input file defines a directed graph `G` with four nodes (A, B, C, and D) and four directed edges (A -> B, B -> C, C -> D, D -> A).

Command to run Graphviz with this input file:

```
dot -Tpng simple.dot -o simple.png
```
This command instructs Graphviz to create a PNG image (`-Tpng`) from the input file `simple.dot`, and save it as `simple.png`. Different formats like SVG, PDF can also be specified.

Note: The file name and image output type can be changed accordingly. The structure and relationship of nodes can also be defined in the input file as required.
