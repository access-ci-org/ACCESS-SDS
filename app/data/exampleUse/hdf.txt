Use Case: HDF (Hierarchical Data Format) is a set of file formats (HDF4, HDF5) designed to store and organize large amounts of data. It is used in various scientific fields and is popular among astronomers, earth scientists, and engineers.

Code details and examples: 

HDF5 is the most recent version. An example would be creating a dataset. HDF5 stores the data in a hierarchical structure, similar to a file system. Here we will create a dataset within the HDF5 file. 

Python code for creating HDF5 file with some data would look like below: 

```python
import h5py
import numpy as np

# Create a new HDF5 file
file = h5py.File('mytestfile.hdf5', 'w')

# Create a dataset in the file
dataset = file.create_dataset(
    "mydataset", 
    np.arange(100).reshape((10, 10)), 
    dtype='i')
file.close()
```

Here, 'mytestfile.hdf5' is the name of the HDF5 file and 'mydataset' is the name of the dataset being created. The data stored in the dataset is a 10x10 array of integers from 0 through 99.

To run the code, simply type in the command: python myscript.py (Given, 'myscript.py' is the file containing the above python code).

HDF5 also provides command line utilities 'h5dump' and 'h5ls' to inspect the content of the HDF5 file.

h5ls lists the content of the hdf5 file and h5dump dumps (prints the content of) the hdf5 file.

To use them, 

To list the content of the hdf5 file, you can use :
```bash
h5ls mytestfile.hdf5
```

To dump the content of hdf5 file, you can use :
```bash
h5dump mytestfile.hdf5
```

(Note: The above commands assume you have 'h5dump' and 'h5ls' utilities installed and added to your path)
