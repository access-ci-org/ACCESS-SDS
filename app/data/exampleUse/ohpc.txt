Use Case: OpenHPC is a software stack that provides various tools for HPC system software developers. It includes provisioning tools, resource management, I/O clients, development tools, and a variety of scientific libraries. 

Code Details and Examples:

Code: 

The OpenHPC system does not require input files as such as it's a software stack providing a variety of tools for HPC system software development.

The code for running an operation using OpenHPC's tools will vary depending on the specific tool being used, but a general job submission using Slurm (a core part of OpenHPC) is as follows:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH --job-name=test_job
#SBATCH --ntasks=16
#SBATCH --time=10:00
#SBATCH --partition=compute

echo "Running job $SLURM_JOB_ID on $SLURM_JOB_NODELIST"

srun hostname
```

This script will submit a job named "test_job" to the cluster, requesting 16 tasks (CPU cores) and a maximum time of 10 minutes. The `srun hostname` command just runs the `hostname` command across all the requested cores, returning the host name of each core.

Save this script as a .sh file, say job.sh, and submit the job to the cluster with:

```bash
sbatch job.sh
``` 

`sbatch` is the command used in the Slurm workload manager to submit a job to the cluster. 

Again, this is a fairly basic example, and the specific invocation will depend heavily on the exact task you're trying to accomplish.
