Use Case: The Biostrings package in R provides memory-efficient storage and manipulation facilities for large biological sequences or sets of sequences. It is typically used in bioinformatics for sequence alignment and other sequence analysis tasks.

Code details and examples:

Here is a simple use case involving DNA sequences.

Code:

```R
# Import necessary library
library(Biostrings)

# Create DNA sequences
seq1 = DNAString("GAATTC")
seq2 = DNAString("GAGTTC")

# Print sequences
print(seq1)
print(seq2)

# Compute pairwise distance between sequences
dist = pairwiseAlignment(seq1, seq2)

# Print result
print(dist)
```

The input for this software package doesn't need a file. Any DNA or RNA sequence in string format can be input directly in the R script.

To run the code, open up an R or RStudio session and simply paste the code into the console and press enter. If this is in a script file, it can be run within R or RStudio with the source command:

```R
source("your_script.R")
```
