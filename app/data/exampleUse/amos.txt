Use Case: AMOS is a collection of tools and class interfaces for the assembly of DNA reads. The package includes a robust infrastructure, modular assembly pipelines, and tools for overlapping, consensus generation, contigging, and assembly manipulation.

Code details and examples: 

Code:
```
# Run AMOS
toAmos -s reads.fq -o reads.afg
# Convert fastq to .afg
minimus2 reads
```

The `toAmos` command converts a fastq file to .afg format required by AMOS. 

Input File: Fastq File (reads.fq)

Example Fastq file format:

```
@SEQ_ID
GATTTGGGGTTCAAAGCAGTATCGATCAAATAGTAAATCCATTTGTTCAACTCACAGTTT
+
!''*((((***+))%%%++)(%%%%).1***-+*''))**55CCF>>>>>>CCCCCCC65
```

Specifications:
On each fastq record:
Line 1 begins with a '@' character in the first column, and encodes the sequence identifier.
Line 2 is the raw sequence
Line 3 begins with a '+' character and encodes the optional identifier.
Line 4 encodes the quality values for the sequence.

Command to run:

```
runAMOS -C reads.frg
```
