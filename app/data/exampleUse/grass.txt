Use Case: Spatial data analysis and geoprocessing in Geographic Information Systems (GIS)

Code details and examples: 

With GRASS GIS, geographic data are typically imported with the `r.in.gdal` or `v.in.ogr` modules. For example, to import a GeoTIFF file:

Code:

    #Import the raster file
    r.in.gdal input=DEM.tif output=dem

To perform a slope aspect analysis on the imported raster data:

Code:

    # Calculate slope and aspect
    r.slope.aspect elevation=dem slope=slope aspect=aspect

The output format is auto detected from the output file's extension or can be manually set with the format option. To export the result as a GeoTIFF:

Code:

    # Export the result
    r.out.gdal input=slope output=slope.tif

To run these commands, GRASS GIS should be opened in a GRASS GIS session with the appropriate location and mapset.
