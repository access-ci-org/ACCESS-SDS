Use Case: Ncview is a visual browser for netCDF format files. It can be used for viewing data stored in netCDF format such as multi-dimensional climate data or geospatial data.

Code details and examples:

Code:
```bash
ncview sample_data.nc
```
In the above code, 'sample_data.nc' is the netCDF file that you want to view. Ncview does not require a specific format for netCDF files as it is just a viewer.

Input File: The input to ncview is a netCDF file. netCDF (Network Common Data Form) is a set of software libraries and machine-independent data formats that support the creation, access, and sharing of array-oriented scientific data. 

Command to run the code: Open a terminal in the directory of the netCDF file you want to view and type the above code.

Example of a netCDF file: 

```bash
netcdf sample_data {
dimensions:
    lon = 53 ;
    lat = 89 ;
variables:
    double lon(lon) ;
        lon:units = "degrees_east" ;
    double lat(lat) ;
        lat:units = "degrees_north" ;
double temp(lat, lon) ;
        temp:long_name = "temperature" ;
        temp:units = "C" ;
        temp:missing_value = -9999. ;
}
```
In the above example, there are two dimensions 'lat' and 'lon', and one variable 'temp' which is a 2D array with lat and lon as its dimensions. The variable 'temp' also has attributes like long_name, units, and missing_value.

This is not a Python script, so it does not contain Python libraries. Nor is it a part of bioinformatics or computational chemistry package. The software itself can be considered a scientific tool as it helps in visualizing scientific data.
