Use Case: utf8proc is a small, clean C library that provides Unicode normalization, case-folding, and other operations for data in the UTF-8 encoding. It's useful for any application that needs to handle text in a way that's aware of Unicode's various features.

Code details and examples:

Code: 

First, include `utf8proc.h` in your C code:

```c
#include <utf8proc.h>
```

Consider a program which normalizes a UTF-8 string:

```c
#include <utf8proc.h>
#include <string.h> 
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
  const char *src = "NFD Normalization needed for this 𝔘𝔫𝔦𝔠𝔬𝔡𝔢 text!";
  utf8proc_uint8_t *dst;
  
  utf8proc_ssize_t dstlen = utf8proc_map(
    (const utf8proc_uint8_t *) src, strlen(src) + 1,
    &dst, UTF8PROC_COMPOSE | UTF8PROC_NULLTERM
  );
  
  if (dstlen < 0) {
    fprintf(stderr, "Error normalizing string: %s\n", utf8proc_errmsg(dstlen));
    return 1;
  }

  printf("Normalized string: %s\n", dst);

  free(dst);

  return 0;
}
```

In the above code, we're first declaring a source string `src` that will be normalized. Then, we call `utf8proc_map` on the source string (`src`) and the length of the source string with options `UTF8PROC_COMPOSE` and `UTF8PROC_NULLTERM` to get the result. If there's an error during normalization, an error message is printed to `stderr`. Otherwise, the normalized string is printed to stdout. It's important to remember to free `dst` after you're done using it.

You can compile this code with the command:
```bash
gcc -o normalize normalize.c -lutf8proc
```

And then run the compiled program with:
```bash
./normalize
```
