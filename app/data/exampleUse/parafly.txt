Use Case: ParaFly is a highly scalable and efficient job scheduler system designed for running tasks in parallel on multi-core computers, assuming that each task is independent of others. It is particularly useful for scheduling and running computational tasks with high computational load.

Code details and examples:

Code:
  
    import subprocess
    
    // Declare your tasks as strings 
    task1 = "sleep 10"
    task2 = "sleep 5"
    task3 = "sleep 20"

    // Pass your tasks into the jobs_list
    jobs_list = [task1, task2, task3]

    // Create a command string with your tasks
    cmd_string = "; ".join(jobs_list)

    // Execute the command string using subprocess
    subprocess.call(["ParaFly", "-c", cmd_string, "-CPU", str(len(jobs_list))]) 

Sample Input: 

This script doesn't take any input file. However, the software takes a list of tasks (ideally shell commands) and a number of CPUs to distribute the load. 

Specify Input file format and details and any specifications:

No specific format is required for input jobs as they are often system commands or calls to other scripts/programs. One should ensure that the commands provided are all executable in the shell environment where ParaFly will be running.

Command to Run: 

To execute the above written python script named `parafly_example.py`, run the following command in the terminal: 

```python parafly_example.py``` 

If one wishes to run ParaFly directly from the shell with a list of commands `commands.txt` and using 8 CPUs, the command will be:
   
```ParaFly -c commands.txt -CPU 8```

Each line in `commands.txt` represents a task for ParaFly to execute.
