Use Case: FreeBayes is a variant detection algorithm tool used in genomics for calling variations in sequenced data. It is utilized to detect SNPs(Single Nucleotide Polymorphism), SVs(Structural Variations) or MNPs(Multi-nucleotide Polymorphisms) in the sequences.

Code details and examples:

Code:

```
# Sample command to run freebayes
freebayes -f ref.fa aln.bam >var.vcf
```

Here, `ref.fa` is the reference sequence in FASTA format, `aln.bam` is the aligned sequence reads in Binary Alignment/Map (BAM) format, and `var.vcf` is the output file containing detected variants in Variant Call Format (VCF).

Input File:

1. Reference sequence file (`ref.fa`): This is the input reference sequence in FASTA format. An example of the format:

```
>seq0
AGCTGACTGACTGACTG
```

2. Aligned sequence reads (`aln.bam`): This file contains aligned sequenced data in BAM format. BAM files are binary files and not human-readable but are usually created from human-readable SAM files. Here is an example SAM file that could be converted to BAM:

```
@SQ    SN:seq0    LN:17
read1    0    seq0    1    60    17M    *    0    0    AGCTGACTGACTGACTG    * 
```

Output File:

1. Detected Variants (`var.vcf`): The output file in VCF format contains the variations detected by FreeBayes. An example:

```
##fileformat=VCFv4.2
#CHROM    POS    ID    REF    ALT    QUAL    FILTER    INFO    FORMAT    sample1
seq0    3    .    T    G    .    .    .    GT    1/1
```

In this case, the variant is an SNP where the nucleotide T has been replaced with G at position 3 of the sequence.

Remember, you must index your BAM file before using it with FreeBayes, which can be done with the `samtools index` command. You should also ensure that your FASTA reference file has been processed with the `samtools faidx` command for indexing.
