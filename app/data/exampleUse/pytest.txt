Use Case: Pytest is a robust python testing tool that allows developers to effortlessly write simple, scalable tests for their applications and libraries. 

Code details and examples:

Code: 
```python
# content of test_sample.py
def func(x):
    return x + 1

def test_answer():
    assert func(3) == 5
```
In this case, the function func(x) returns the value of x + 1. The function test_answer() is used by pytest to test if the function func(3) returns the value 5. To run the test file:

Command to run:
```
$ pytest
```

The command above will execute all the test files in the current directory and subdirectories. If there is a need to specify a particular test file, that can be provided as an argument to pytest like so:

```
$ pytest test_sample.py
```

This will only run the tests in the 'test_sample.py' file.
