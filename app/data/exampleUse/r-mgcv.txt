Use Case: Using mgcv package in R for generalized additive model fitting;

Code details and examples:

Code:

```R
# Loading the required library
library(mgcv)

# Creating some sample data
set.seed(0)
n <- 400
sig <- 2
x0 <- runif(n, 0, 1)
x1 <- 2 * (runif(n, 0, 1) - 0.5)
x2 <- 2 * (runif(n, 0, 1) - 0.5)
y <- sin(12 * (x0 + 0.2)) / (0.1 + (x0 + 0.2)^2) + 0.1 * x1 * x2 + rnorm(n, 0, sig)

# Creating a data frame
dat <- data.frame(y = y, x0 = x0, x1 = x1, x2 = x2)

# Fitting a GAM model
fit <- gam(y ~ s(x0, k = 20) + s(x1, x2, k = 40), data = dat)

# Printing the summary of the model fit
summary(fit)
```

Input files required: Variable data in R compatible formats (like Rdata, CSV, etc.).

Input Files Format: This doesn't use any file inputs, but Data frames used as input.

Specifications and details in input files: gam() function requires formula as input based on which model is fitted. It uses smooth terms s(). 'k' in smooth term is the maximum number of basis for the smooth. 

Command to run: Above code can be run directly in R environment, or using 'Rscript filename.R' in command line.
