Use Case: You want to do single-cell transcriptomics data (scRNA-seq) analysis by using Scanpy library in Python, and visualize the main cell clusters that make up the mouse visual cortex with Louvain groups.

Code details and examples:

Input File Format: Scanpy supports the file format of newick(.nwk), h5ad(.h5ad), graphml, xml, leiden(.lbg), plain text files, and csv files loaded with either pandas or numpy.

Sample Input File: Here, we will need a file "mouse_visual_cortex.h5ad" which is a sample data file to visualize the main cell clusters that make up the mouse visual cortex. 

```Python
import scanpy as sc

# Read the h5ad file into an AnnData object
adata = sc.read('mouse_visual_cortex.h5ad')

# Perform preprocessing steps
sc.pp.neighbors(adata, n_neighbors=10, n_pcs=40)

# Compute a clustering for the dataset
sc.tl.louvain(adata, resolution=1.0)

# Visualizing the cluster with UMAP
sc.tl.umap(adata)

# Plotting the cluster
sc.pl.umap(adata, color=['louvain'])
```

Command to run: Above Python code can be copied in a Python script say "analysis.py" and run by: python analysis.py. Remember to have "mouse_visual_cortex.h5ad" file in the same directory where python script is present.
