Use Case: Use MCell for modeling complex microscopic biochemical systems, such as inside living cells. It can track molecules in a 3D space over time executing their modifications. 

Code details and examples: Code :

Input File: The input to MCell is a plain text MDL (MCell Development Language) file. The MDL file describes the physical system and chemical reactions. Here is a simple example of MDL file:

```
// Create box
WORLD_BOX
{
  [0,0,0]
  [1,1,1]
}
 
// Place molecules
DEFINE_MOLECULES
{
  MOL_A
  {
    DIFFUSION_CONSTANT_3D = 1e-06 [um^2 us^1] [molecules=1e15]
  }
}
 
//Create an instantiation for placement of molecules. 
INSTANTIATIONS
{
  DEFAULT_RELEASE
  {
    MOL_A = [[0,0,0]]
  }
}
```
This simple example creates a cubic world box of size 1 um and places a single `MOL_A` molecule at the origin.

Run the MCell simulation : 

Command to run this MDL file, named `test.mdl`, is: 
```
mcell test.mdl
```
