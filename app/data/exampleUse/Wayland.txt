Use Case: Use Wayland for creating an efficient, modern and extensible protocol to connect clients and a display server, typically used in Linux desktops;

Code details and examples: Code.
Wayland doesn't work with programming libraries directly, its main functionality is used by display server such as "Weston". However, we can use PyWayland library to interface with the Wayland protocol.

For instance, you can create a simple Wayland client in Python:

```python
from pywayland.client import Display

# Create Display
display = Display()

# Connect to the Wayland server
display.connect()

# Handle events
while True:
    display.dispatch()
```

It is important to note that, in practice, Wayland clients would be significantly more complex. They would draw upon existing libraries such as GTK or Qt for GUI development, rather than attempting to interface with the Wayland protocol directly. This is an oversimplified case which does not provide a complete usage scenario for "Wayland". You can refer packages like 'weston' or libraries like 'libwayland-dev' for better examples. 

To run the above script, give the command
```sh
python3 scriptname.py
```
Consider saving above python code to the file `scriptname.py`. Here, we are using `python3` to run the Python script. The actual command may vary depending on the Python setup and the filename.
