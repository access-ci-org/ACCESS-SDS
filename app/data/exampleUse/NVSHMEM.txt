Use Case: NVSHMEM (Nvidia OpenSHMEM) is utilized for message passing in parallel computing. It enables direct communication between multiple GPUs in a single node or across various nodes. 

Code details and examples: 

Sample input file format may include parallel processing commands. 

In NVSHMEM, after initialization with `shmem_init()`, processes can then call OpenSHMEM operations. For instance, `shmem_put(dest, source, nelems, pe)` can be used to add elements from a local variable to a remote variable.

Command to run:

To run an NVSHMEM program, commands similar to the below would be used.

```
$ nvcc -o hello_world hello_world.cu
$ ./hello_world
```

Code:

```C
#include <stdio.h>
#include <nvshmem.h>

__global__ void hello_world() {
    printf("Hello, World from GPU %d of %d!\n",
           nvshmem_my_pe(), nvshmem_n_pes());
}

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
    nvshmem_init();
    hello_world<<<1,1>>>();
    cudaDeviceSynchronize();
    nvshmem_finalize();
    return 0;
}
```
In this example, the function `nvshmem_my_pe()` returns the PE number of the calling PE and `nvshmem_n_pes()` returns the total number of PEs in the job. Upon successful initialization with `nvshmem_init()`, an NVSHMEM job comprises one or more symmetric heaps equal in size that span all execution Processing Elements (PEs), and each PE is assigned a unique 0-based PE number.
