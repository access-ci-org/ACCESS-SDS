Use Case: Running parallel operations in R.

Code details and examples: 

Code:

```R
# Load the required package
library(foreach);
library(doParallel)

# Register the parallel backend
cl <- makeCluster(2)
registerDoParallel(cl)

# Define the function to be run in parallel
fun <- function(i) {
  # Some time-consuming operation
  Sys.sleep(runif(1, 0, 1))
  
  # Return a random number
  runif(1)
}

# Use foreach to run the function in parallel
results <- foreach(i = 1:10) %dopar% {
  fun(i)
}

# Print the results
print(results)

# Stop the parallel backend
stopCluster(cl)
```

In this code snippet, `foreach` is used to run a function in parallel across a number of iterations. The number of iterations here is set to 10. 

The function `fun` simply sleeps for a random amount of time between 0 and 1 second, then returns a random number. This function is run in parallel for each of the iterations. 

The results of the computations are collected and printed to the console. The parallel backend is then turned off with the `stopCluster` function. 

The command to run the file will be `Rscript filename.R` where `filename.R` is the name of your R file.
