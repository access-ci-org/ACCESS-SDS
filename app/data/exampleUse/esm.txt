Use Case: ESMValTool is a community diagnostics and performance metrics tool for routine evaluation of Earth system models in CMIP (Coupled Model Intercomparison Project). It is designed to facilitate the assessment of the strength and weaknesses of Earth system models. It makes it quicker and easier to perform tasks routinely needed for model evaluation, and so allows scientists to focus on actually analyzing the diagnostics and model results.

Code details and examples: Code

1. Prepare your recipe
A recipe is a text file in Yaml file format (.yml). It specifies which preprocessed data to use, which diagnostics to run, and how to produce plots. Here is an example of a very simple recipe:

```YAML
documentation:

    - righi_mattia
  title: "Recipe example"

    variables:
      tas:
        preprocessor: preprocessor1
        project: CMIP6
        mip: Amon
        exp: historical
        ensemble: r1i1p1f1
        grid: gn
        start_year: 1850
        end_year: 1852
    scripts:
      script1:
        script: examples/diagnostic.py
```

2. Run the recipe
First, open a terminal window and change directory to where you installed ESMValTool.

`cd ESMValTool`

Then, you can run the recipe with the command

`esmvaltool run esmvaltool/recipes/examples/recipe_python.yml`

(Replace `esmvaltool/recipes/examples/recipe_python.yml` with the path to your recipe.)

3. Output
ESMValTool produces a number of different types of output, including NetCDF files, log files and plots, which are all stored in the 'output' directory in the directory where you ran the recipe. The name of the output directory begins with "recipe_" and ends with the current date and time (YearMonthDay_hourminute).
