Use Case: GLM is a popular C++ mathematics library designed for software based on the OpenGL Shading Language (GLSL) specifications. It's typically used for graphics software requiring complex mathematical operations involving vectors and matrices. For instance, a video game developer might use it to handle character movements or camera angles.

Code details and examples: 

Code: 
Let's suppose we are trying to perform a simple vector addition operation with GLM. We would typically initialize two vectors, add them, and store the result in a third vector. Here's how that might look in C++:

```C++
#include <glm/glm.hpp>

int main()
{
    glm::vec3 vectorA(1.0f, 2.0f, 3.0f);
    glm::vec3 vectorB(4.0f, 5.0f, 6.0f);

    glm::vec3 sum = vectorA + vectorB;
    
    return 0;
}
```

To compile, and run the program, you typically use g++ compiler in the terminal. Replace "filename.cpp" with the actual name of your file.

```bash
g++ filename.cpp -o output_name
./output_name
```

Input specification: The input for a GLM function or method usually comes in the form of GLM vector or matrix objects, or primitive data types that can be used to construct those objects (e.g., integer or floating point numbers).

For example, the glm::vec3 constructor used in the code above takes three floating point numbers as input, representing the x, y, and z components of a 3D vector, respectively. There is no separate input file. 

Format required: The format required is the standard C++ syntax recognized by the GLM library. The above input data should be written directly in the code. There's typically no need for an external input file when working with GLM, as its operations are usually performed programmatically rather than through user input. However, if needed, standard file I/O operations in C++ can be used to read data from a file.

Note: Always remember to handle exceptions and validate user inputs to ensure that they meet the desired standards.
