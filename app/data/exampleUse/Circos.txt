Use Case: Circos is a powerful visualization tool for genomic data that employs a circular layout to represent relationships between genomic intervals. It is used to identify patterns and trends in complex datasets and is highly configurable given it's designed for creating publication-quality infographics.

Code details and examples: 

Code:

```bash
circos -conf circos.conf
```

Input File:

The configuration file is typically named circos.conf. There are various types of input file formats used including parsed text files (.txt) and karyotype files (.karyotype). Data is typically tab-delimited, where the values depend on the type of data being represented, such as scatter, histogram, heatmap, etc.

Sample circos.conf:

```bash
<<include etc/colors_fonts_patterns.conf>>
<<include etc/housekeeping.conf>>

<karyotype>
data/karyotype/karyotype.human.txt
</karyotype>

<<include ideogram.conf>>
<<include ticks.conf>>

<plots>

<plot>
<file>
data/5/chr.k562.genes.txt
</file>
<type>
heatmap
</type>
</plot>

</plots>

<<include image.conf>>
```

Specific rules in the input files:
- Comment lines (beginning with a #) and empty lines are ignored.
- Tabs separate fields (except within <image>, <colors>, <fonts>, <patterns>, and <links> blocks).
- A block begins with `<blockname>`.
- A block ends with `</blockname>`.
- Within a block, lines can be of the form `<name>value<name>` or `value`.
- The order of blocks is irrelevant.
- Blocks that appear more than once are concatenated.

Equally, you would need a 'karyotype.human.txt' and 'chr.k562.genes.txt' file in the appropriate directories with the right data for this example to work.

Command to run:

```bash
circos -conf circos.conf
```
