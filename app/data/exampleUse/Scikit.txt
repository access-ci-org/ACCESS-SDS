Use Case: For data mining and data analysis. Itâ€™s built on NumPy, SciPy, and matplotlib for Python.

Code Details and Examples: 

Code:
```
from sklearn import datasets
from sklearn import svm

# load iris dataset as an example
iris = datasets.load_iris()
X_iris = iris.data
Y_iris = iris.target

# Using the SVC class to perform a Support Vector Classification.
svc = svm.SVC(kernel='linear')

# Split iris data in train and test data
# A random permutation, to split the data randomly
np.random.seed(0)
indices = np.random.permutation(len(X_iris))

X_train = X_iris[indices[:-10]]
Y_train = Y_iris[indices[:-10]]
X_test  = X_iris[indices[-10:]]
Y_test  = Y_iris[indices[-10:]]

# Perform classification 
svc.fit(X_train, Y_train)
```
The data input is done through datasets.load_iris() which is built into scikit. The load_iris function loads the iris dataset in form of a multidimensional array which is then manipulated and used for machine learning with the svc.fit() function.

The format required for scikit is arrays (can be multidimensional), and can be .csv files as well but you also have to use a numpy liner to convert the .csv file into an array.

Command to run it:
```
python filename.py
```
