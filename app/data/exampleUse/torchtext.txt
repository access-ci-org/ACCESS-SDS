Use Case: torchtext is a python package that consists of text data processing utilities and popular datasets for natural language processing (NLP).
 
Code details and examples:

Code:

Sample input files: The input files could be text files specially formatted for NLP tasks. An example can be .CSV files with each row representing an example (a sentence, a label etc.). They should be readable files and could contain rows corresponding to text and their respective classes, for instance, in a sentiment analysis task.

Code Snippet:

```python
import torch
from torchtext.legacy import data

# define how to process the text data and its label
TEXT = data.Field(sequential=True, tokenize='spacy', lower=True)
LABEL = data.LabelField(dtype=torch.float)

fields = [('text',TEXT), ('label',LABEL)]

# create a dataset from your csv file. In the csv file below, 'sentence' column corresponds to the text data and 'label' column is the tag.
train_data = data.TabularDataset.splits(
                                        path = 'path-to-your-csv-folder',
                                        train = 'your-csv-filename.csv',
                                        format = 'csv',
                                        fields = fields,
                                        skip_header = True)

# build the vocabulary from the text data
TEXT.build_vocab(train_data, max_size=10000, vectors="glove.6B.100d", unk_init=torch.Tensor.normal_)

```

To run above code, the command would be:
`python filename.py`

In the command, filename.py is a file containing the above torchtext processing script. You need running python environment with necessary dependencies like torchtext and spacy installed to run the command successfully.
