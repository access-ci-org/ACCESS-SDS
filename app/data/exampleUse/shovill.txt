Use Case: Shovill is a pipeline that uses SPAdes to assemble bacterial genomes from short-read sequencing data(low-overlap). It uses FastQC, Trimmomatic, FLASH or other software to preprocess the reads. 

Code Details and Examples: 

Sample input files: The input files required are forward and reverse pair of reads.

forward_reads.fasta
reverse_reads.fasta

Command to run the Shovill pipeline:
```
shovill --outdir /path/to/output_dir --R1 /path/to/forward_reads.fasta --R2 /path/to/reverse_reads.fasta
```
Note: Replace "/path/to/output_dir" with your desired path for output directory and "/path/to/forward_reads.fasta" and "/path/to/reverse_reads.fasta" with the paths to your input files.

The pipeline uses several parameters for the execution. The key ones are: 

--outdir : Give the output directory, the pipeline will die if the directory already exists

--R1 and --R2 : The forward and reverse reads. The pipeline expects them to be in Fastq format(.fasta/.fq).

Optional Parameters:

--depth : The depth to aim when doing the initial read subsampling (default: 100)

--minlen : Minimum length contig to return (default: 500)

--asm : Which assembler to to use. It defaults to 'spades', but can be switched to use 'megahit', 'skesa' or 'velvet'. 

--trim : Enable read trimming (default: enabled)

--opts : Pass custom options to the assembler. 

The output from Shovill includes: 
1. contigs.fa – The final contigs in FASTA format.
2. contigs.gfa – The assembly graph in GFA format.
3. spades.fasta – The raw assembly as produced by SPAdes without any of Shovill's post-processing.
4. shovill.log – The log file which may be useful to diagnose problems.

Shovill package also includes several small utility scripts which are helpful for sequence data preprocessing and postprocessing. Some of them include 'sealer', 'cleanup', 'corrections' etc. 

For example, to use 'corrections' script, the command should look like:

```
corrections --outdir /path/to/output_dir --R1 /path/to/corrected_forward_reads.fasta --R2 /path/to/corrected_reverse_reads.fasta
```
