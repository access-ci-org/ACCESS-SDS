Use Case: dm-tree is a Python library that offers efficient and memory-saving tree implementations. It widely uses the tree structure as part of the computation in reinforcement learning, language modeling, algorithms, etc.

Code details and examples: 

Code:
```python

from dm_tree import Tree

# Build a tree
tree_obj = Tree({
    'a': 1,
    'b': [2, 3],
    'c': {
        'd': 4,
        'e': 5
    }
})

print(tree_obj)

# Accessing values
print(tree_obj['a'])
print(tree_obj['b'])
print(tree_obj['c']['d'])
print(tree_obj['c']['e'])

# Adding a node
tree_obj['f'] = 6
print(tree_obj)
```

In this mentioned code, the tree is generated using a dictionary where each key-value pair represents a node and its associated value. The nodes can be accessed using the key values just like a regular dictionary. New nodes can also be added similarly. This code does not need any specific input file.

To run this code, navigate to the directory of your Python file and run this command:
```bash
python filename.py
```
