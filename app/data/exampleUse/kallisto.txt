Use Case: Kallisto is a program for quantifying abundances of transcripts from bulk and single-cell RNA-Seq data, or more generally of target sequences using high-throughput sequencing reads. It is based on the novel idea of pseudoalignment for rapidly determining the compatibility of reads with targets, without the need for alignment.

Code details and examples: Code

Example input files:

    transcripts.fasta - A FASTA file containing target sequences (such as transcript sequences).

    reads_1.fastq - A FASTQ file containing sequencing reads.

    reads_2.fastq - Another FASTQ file for paired-end reads. Optionally this can be omitted for single-end reads.

    index.idx - The index file generated by Kallisto, used to pseudoalign the reads.

Specifications and details in input files:

The FASTA file should contain sequences in the standard FASTA format. The FASTQ files should also be standard, with each entry containing a sequence and a quality string.

The index file is generated by Kallisto and doesn't need to be hand-prepared. It must correspond to the sequences in the FASTA file.

Code snippets:

First, you must build the index from the FASTA file:

    kallisto index -i index.idx transcripts.fasta

Here, "-i index.idx" designates the output file for the index.

Then, you can run the quantification:

    kallisto quant -i index.idx -o output reads_1.fastq reads_2.fastq

In this command, "-i index.idx" designates the index file, "-o output" designates the directory where the output will be stored, and "reads_1.fastq reads_2.fastq" are the input sequencing reads.

The output will be several files containing the abundance estimates for each target sequence. Also, a file with statistical bootstrap estimates if the "-b" option is used.
