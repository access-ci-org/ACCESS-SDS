Use Case: Use ONNX (Open Neural Network Exchange) to import deep learning models from different frameworks (like PyTorch, Caffe2, etc) into other frameworks (like tensorflow) for testing and deploying.

Code details and examples: Code.

ONNX is in fact not a deep learning framework but actually serves as an intermediate representation of your model, making it possible to convert your model from one framework to another.

Example file (model.onnx):
This is a binary format file which is used by ONNX to save the model. This file can't be created or edited manually.

When exporting an ONNX file from a supported framework (ex: PyTorch), the input should look something like this:

```python
import torch
import torch.onnx

dummy_input = torch.randn(1, 3, 224, 224)  # Model input, it's a tensor
model = torchvision.models.alexnet(pretrained=True)  # Loaded model
torch.onnx.export(model, dummy_input, "model.onnx")  # Exporting model
```

After you've exported your model to ONNX, using the ONNX model in another framework (ex: Tensorflow) might look something like this:

```python
import onnx
from onnx_tf.backend import prepare

onnx_model = onnx.load("model.onnx")  # Load ONNX model
tf_rep = prepare(onnx_model)  # Convert ONNX model to Tensorflow format
tf_rep.export_graph("model.pb")  # Export to .pb file for Tensorflow
```

Subsequently, the resulting .pb file can be loaded in Tensorflow and used for further processing and deployment.
