Use Case: FormatR is an R package that is used for reformatting the R code to make it more legible and standard. It aids in making the code more readable and hence, more maintainable in a long run. The R code format includes the spaces around operators, the proper indentation, the consistent line return, and the reasonable use of white space.

Code details and examples:

Code:

In R, say that we have a piece of code formatted as follows:

```R    
multiline_string =
"this is a long string
 that spans multiple
 lines" 
```

To reformat this piece of code using formatR, we would enter:

```R
library(formatR)
str = '
multiline_string =
"this is a long string
that spans multiple
lines" 
'

tidy_source(text = str)
```

Output:

```
multiline_string = "this is a long string
that spans multiple
lines"
```
In this example, the FormatR package is used to tidy up the spacing in the R code snippet. It works to ensure the R code is as readable as possible by operating on the spacing in the provided code snippet.

To run FormatR, launch your R interface, load the library with the command `library(formatR)`, and apply the function `tidy_source()` as required on your source code. The main function in FormatR is `tidy_source()`, which can be used to reformat R scripts.
