Use Case: Mesa (Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics) involves modeling, testing and simulating stars throughout their life cycles. A use case could be tracking the changes in a star's luminosity and temperature during its evolution. 

Code details and examples: 

Code:

File: inlist_project

```
&star_job

    save_model_filename = 'models/model'
    save_model_when_ever_true = .true.

/

&controls

   log_directory = 'logs'

   initial_mass = 1
   initial_z = 0.02

   use_Type2_if_possible = .false.
   use_massive_prescriptions = .false.

   rgb_wind_scheme = 'Reimers'
   agb_wind_scheme = 'VW'

   cool_wind_RGB_scheme = 'Blocker'
   cool_wind_AGB_scheme = 'Wannier'
   ...
   hot_wind_scheme = 'Reimers'

   do_composition_gradient = .false.

   PGstar_flag = .true.

/

&pgstar

   HR_win_flag = .true.
   HR_file_flag = .true.
   photo_file_flag = .true.

   Profile_win_flag = .true.
   Profile_win_file_flag = .true.
   ...

/
```
To run a mesa star job, use:

`./rn`

Command to run the MESA code may differ depending on your setup and version of the MESA code. 

This input file starts a star evolution job, saving a model whenever possible and logging data to a specific directory. It sets initial conditions for the star, including mass and metallicity, and it uses specific wind schemes for different phases of stellar evolution. It does not account for a composition gradient. It plots results in a Hertzsprung-Russell diagram (HR diagram) and outputs photo and profile data.
