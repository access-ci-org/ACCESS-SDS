Use Case: AnchorWave is used for pairwise local alignment of Wavelet transformed DNA sequences. 

Code Details and Examples: 

AnchorWave has a simple command line interface to calculate pairwise wavelet based local alignment.

Command to run: 
`anchorwave sequences.fasta output.align`

Format Required:

For input, Anchorwave requires a fasta file format with information about the sequences to be aligned. 

Here's an example of Fasta file:

```
>sequence1
AGTCTGACGTAGCT
>sequence2
AGTCGGGTGTA
```

Specifications and Details in Input Files:

Fasta files begin with a description line, which starts with ">", followed by the sequence itself, on one line or multiple lines. The actual sequences are represented with upper case letters such as A, T, G, and C. 

Code snippet:

```python
from Bio import SeqIO
from anchorwave import pairwise

sequences = SeqIO.parse('sequences.fasta', 'fasta')

aligned = pairwise.align(sequences)
```

This script will read sequences from "sequences.fasta", performs pairwise alignment, and stores the result in the variable aligned.
