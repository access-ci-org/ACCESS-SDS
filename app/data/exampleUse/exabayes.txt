Use Case: ExaBayes is a software package for Bayesian phylogenetic analysis. It is able to solve large scale phylogenetic problems on supercomputers through MPI parallelization.

Code Details and Examples:

The ExaBayes tool operates on a variety of input file types, including common formats for phylogenetic data like nexus and phylip.

Input File Format: Nexus (.nex) or Phylip (.phy).

Input File Specifications: The input file consists of DNA or protein sequence alignments in the specified formats.

Code Snippets:

Consider a simple Nexus file ‘myseq.nex’:

```
#NEXUS
BEGIN DATA;
DIMENSIONS NTAX=2 NCHAR=4;
FORMAT DATATYPE=dna INTERLEAVE=no GAP=- MISSING=? ;
MATRIX
taxon1 AGCT
taxon2 CGTA
;
END;
```

Command to Run:

To run ExaBayes, you typically supply the alignment and parameters via command-line arguments:

```
exabayes -f myseq.nex -n run1
```

This command will run ExaBayes on the alignment contained in the file ‘myseq.nex’; the output files of the run will be prefixed with 'run1'.

ExaBayes will then output a variety of files detailing the phylogenetic analysis, including traces of the model parameters, the inferred trees, and log files. 

Note: The `-n` parameter is used to name the run, and it is highly recommended for organizing multiple runs.
