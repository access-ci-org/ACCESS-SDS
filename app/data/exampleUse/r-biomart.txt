Use Case: Use r-biomart for the retrieval of genomic data from BioMart databases. It is handy for bioinformatics research where large sets of genes and other biological data need to be fetched.

Code details and examples: Code

In R, you can use the biomaRt package like so:

```R
# Load the library
library(biomart)

# Use the useMart function to connect to the Ensembl database
ensembl = useMart("ensembl")

# List the available datasets
datasets = listDatasets(ensembl)
print(datasets)

# Choose a specific dataset
hsapiens = useDataset("hsapiens_gene_ensembl", mart = ensembl)

# Get all the genes on the Y chromosome
genes = getBM(attributes = c("ensembl_gene_id", "external_gene_name"),
               filters = "chromosome_name",
               values = "Y",
               mart = hsapiens)

# Print the data
print(genes)
```

This code will print out all the genes on the human Y chromosome according to the Ensembl database. It first establishes a connection to the Ensembl BioMart, then selects the Homo sapiens dataset and retrieves all the Y chromosome genes.

As for commands to run the script, you would typically do this interactively in Rstudio, or save the script as a .R file and run it with the Rscript command from the terminal:

```
Rscript myscript.R
```
