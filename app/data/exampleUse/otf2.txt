Use Case: OTF2 (Open Trace Format 2) is used as an API and toolkit for reading and writing trace data in HPC. It is utilized in studying the performance analysis of high performance computing applications.

Code details and examples: 

Code: A trace file in OTF2 has a specific format that consists of a sequence of events and can be read using the OTF2 Reader application.

Here is a basic example of an input definition file for OTF2:

```
8                               
2 0 0 "MPI_Send"                 
2 1 0 "MPI_Recv"
2 2 0 "MPI_Isend"
2 3 0 "MPI_Irecv"
2 4 0 "MPI_Wait"
2 5 0 "Compute"
2 6 0 "IO"
2 7 0 "Sync"
```

This file defines several MPI events like send, receive, and different computation and I/O events. The first line denotes the total number of events followed by the event name and type.

Note: The OTF2 software does not require any specific command to run. It usually comes bundled with the Score-P software package which can be used to generate these trace files.

You can trace program execution and generate an event trace for the input program using Score-P. The command for this would look like:

```
scorep --event-tracing-config-file=config.def ./Application
```

Here, `config.def` is a configuration file defining what tracing to track, and `./Application` is the executable file to trace.

The generated traces are stored in the `otf2_trace` directory and can be analyzed using the OTF2 tools.
