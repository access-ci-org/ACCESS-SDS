Use Case: Use chewBBACA for allele calling in microbial genome sequences. 

Code details and examples: Code 

In order to use chewBBACA, you need three input files. 

1. The genome sequences. These should be in the FASTA format and each sequence should be in a separate file. The names of the files should match the names of the sequences. 

2. The schema. This is a file that contains the definition of the alleles. It should be in the Prodigal training file format. 

3. The training file. This is a file that contains the instructions for allele calling. It should be in the Prodigal training file format.

Example for schema (Prodigal training file):
```
> Allele1
ATGGTACCAGATGACCTGACTTCCAGCTCCGATCGACACACATCAAGGAGAACCTAAGGAGAACCTCATGATGACAGCTTGATCCGAG
> Allele2
ATGGTACCGGAAGTCCCGACCCCAAGTCGAACCTGGACCCAGAAGCTCCGACGAGAAGCTGACCAGCTTGACCGATCCGAG
```
Example for training file (Prodigal training file):
```
DIVISION_CODON_POSITIONS_START=20;
DIVISION_CODON_POSITIONS_END=30;
CODON_POSITIONS_START=1;
CODON_POSITIONS_END=3;
```

Command to run chewBBACA:

`chewBBACA.py AlleleCall -i <input_files> -g <genes_files> -o <output_files> --cpu <cpu>`
   
In this command replace `<input_files>`, `<genes_files>`, `<output_files>` and `<cpu>` with the paths to your input genome sequences file, schema, output path and number of processes to use, respectively.
   
In the end, you'll find various output files, including a file with an allele call for each genome sequence.
