Use Case: Running a program on an Intel FPGA using the Intel FPGA OpenCL development kit.
Code details and examples:
Sample input file (vector_add.cl):
```
__kernel void vector_add(__global int *a, __global int *b, __global int *c) {
    int index = get_global_id(0);
    c[index] = a[index] + b[index];
}
```

Command to compile the OpenCL kernel:
```
aoc vector_add.cl -o vector_add.aocx
```

Command to run the program on an Intel FPGA:
```
aocl program acl0 vector_add.aocx
```

This is just a sample code for a vector addition OpenCL kernel for an Intel FPGA, and the actual code and commands could vary based on the specific FPGA device, kernel requirements, and host system setup.
