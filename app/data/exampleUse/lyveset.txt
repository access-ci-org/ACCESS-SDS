Use Case: Lyve-SET is an open-source bioinformatics package developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for high-quality SNP calling. It aligns hundreds to thousands of high throughput sequencing datasets, identifies single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), reconstructs phylogenomics with RAxML or FastTree, and provides genotypes. 

Code details and examples: Code

Required Input Files:
1) Fastq file or other sequence files for genomes

Sample Input File Format: 
- Fastq files each containing short-read sequences. 

Code Snippet: 

```
#Go to lyveset directory
cd Lyve-SET
#Run lyveset
perl lyve-SET.pl --numcpus 8 --run speed --make_tree --mask_everywhere --min_alt_frac 1 --min_coverage 10 --reads_dir datasets/raw_fastq --out_dir sets_out
```
This command runs Lyve-SET from the command line; the code utilizes 8 central processing units (CPUs). It's a speedy mode, making a tree while masking everywhere. The minimum alternate fraction and minimum coverage are set to 1 and 10, respectively. The reads_directory is set to the raw_fastq files in the datasets directory, and out_directory is set to sets_out.
Cmd to run: 
```
perl lyve-SET.pl --numcpus 8 --run speed --make_tree --mask_everywhere --min_alt_frac 1 --min_coverage 10 --reads_dir datasets/raw_fastq --out_dir sets_out
```
