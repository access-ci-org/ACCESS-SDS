Use Case: cuDF is a GPU-accelerated data manipulation tool built over the Apache Arrow columnar memory format. It is a part of the RAPIDS project from NVIDIA. It provides a pandas-like API that will be familiar to data engineers and data scientists, who can use it to efficiently manipulate large datasets.

Code Details and Examples:

Code:

```python
import cudf

df = cudf.DataFrame({'a': range(20),
                     'b': range(20)})
print(df.head())

# Can also convert a pandas dataframe into a cudf dataframe
import pandas as pd
pdf = pd.DataFrame({'a': range(20),
                     'b': range(20)})

cudf_df = cudf.from_pandas(pdf)
print(cudf_df.head())
```

Command to run:
