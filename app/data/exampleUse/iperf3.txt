Use Case: Iperf3 is often used to measure the bandwidth performance of a network. It provides details such as the throughput, loss, transit delay, etc of a network.

Code details and examples: Code

Iperf3 mostly uses command-line interface for utilization. For instance, if we are trying to find the client to server bandwidth of a system, we first run the iperf3 server on the host machine with this command:

```
iperf3 -s
```

Then, on the client machine, we run the iperf3 client command targeting the server's IP Address. Here is a sample command where the IP address of the server is 192.168.1.1:

```
iperf3 -c 192.168.1.1
```

The standard output will then show the bandwidth between the client machine and the server machine.

If we need to specify the port or the time of the test, more command-line options can be applied as follows:

```
iperf3 -c 192.168.1.1 -p 5201 -t 30
```

This command tells iperf to connect to the server at 192.168.1.1, using port 5201, and to conduct the test for 30 seconds.

The input in this case is simply command line arguments and there isn't a requirement for a separate input file.
