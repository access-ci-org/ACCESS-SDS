Use Case: PyYAML is a YAML parser and emitter for the Python programming language. PyYAML allows for the easy and efficient reading and writing of YAML-formatted files in Python, allowing for more straightforward data serialization. 

Code Details and Examples:

Code:

```python
import yaml

# Sample data
data = {
    'name': 'John Doe',
    'age': 30,
    'occupation': 'engineer'
}

# Save data to YAML format
with open('data.yaml', 'w') as file:
    yaml.dump(data, file)

# Load data from YAML file
with open('data.yaml', 'r') as file:
    loaded_data = yaml.load(file, Loader=yaml.FullLoader)

print(loaded_data)
```

This Python code uses the PyYAML library to create a dictionary object and then writes it to a YAML-formatted file using the `dump()` function. It then reads the YAML file using the `load()` function to load the data into another Python object.

The input file is 'data.yaml' with the following data:

```yaml
name: John Doe
age: 30
occupation: engineer
```

To run this python script, let's say it is saved as sample.py. You would open a terminal or command-line window and type the following command:

```bash
python sample.py
```

Please note that prior to running this script, PyYAML must be installed and the script must have read/write permissions to the directory where 'data.yaml' is located.
