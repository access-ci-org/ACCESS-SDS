Use Case: T-Coffee is a multiple sequence alignment software. It can align Protein, DNA and RNA sequences. 

Code details and examples: Code

Sample input file:
```
>SEQ1
ACTGCCTGA
>SEQ2
ACGCTGA
>SEQ3
ACTGCTAGG
```

This file is a standard FASTA file. Each sequence starts with a '>' symbol, followed by the name of the sequence. Multiple sequences can be included in a single file by starting a new line and adding another sequence, beginning with the '>' and the name.

Command to run T-Coffee:
`t_coffee fasta_file.txt` 

T-Coffee will take this fasta file as input and produce the alignment as output. The format of the output file is also a FASTA file. The aligned sequences will be printed under the sequence name, like this:

```
>SEQ1
ACTGCCTGA---
>SEQ2
-AC--GCTGA
>SEQ3
ACTGCTAGG---
```

The dashes '-' represent gaps inserted by the software. The aligned sequences' length will be the same in the FASTA output file.

Code Snippet:

Python code to process the output file:
```python
with open('output.fasta', 'r') as file:
    data = file.readlines()
    for line in data:
        print(line)
```
