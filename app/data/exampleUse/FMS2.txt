Use Case: FMS2 is a software package under The Modular Ocean Model (MOM), a numerical simulation framework for ocean circulation and biogeochemical models. It is especially useful for climate modeling and simulations.

Code details and examples: 

Input files: The input files for FMS2 are mainly text files. They contain parameters and data for the operation of the program.

Parameter "ocean_model_nml"":

```txt
&ocean_model_nml
  dt_cpld=1800.,
  dt_ocean=1800.,
/
```

The above text files should be ended with "/".

Command to run:

```sh
mpirun -np 64 ./MOM6
```

The above command is to run the MOM6 model (which includes FMS2) using 64 processors.
