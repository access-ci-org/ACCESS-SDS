Use Case: ADVNTR is a bioinformatics software that is used to model and study variable number tandem repeats (VNTRs). VNTRs are areas of a genome that have a certain sequence of nucleotides that occur in a repeating pattern. This software can analyze these repeating patterns and help scientists understand their function and role in the genome. 

Code details and examples: 

Code: 

To analyze a VNTR, you need to first have the sequence of the VNTR in a fasta format. The input file should look like this:

```
>sequence1
AGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCT
>sequence2
GATCGATCGTC
```

The command to analyze a VNTR with ADVNTR is as follows: 

```
advntr model -i sequence.fasta -o output.pred
```

The `-i` option specifies the input file, which in this case is `sequence.fasta`. The `-o` option specifies the output file, which in this case is `output.pred`. 

The output file will contain the predicted VNTR model, which can then be used for further analysis.

Please ensure your sequence file is formatted correctly, as the software may not work as expected with incorrectly formatted files.
