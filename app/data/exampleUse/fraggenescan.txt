Use Case: Prediction of protein genes in short and error-prone metagenomic sequences.

Code details and examples: Code

Input Files: 
1. Quality Score File - The necessary input to FragGeneScan is sequence read data in FASTA or fastq(.fq) format. For example, "sequence.fna" or "sequence.fq".

Command to run: 
```bash
Run_FragGeneScan.pl -genome=sequence.fna -out=output -complete=1 -train=complete
```
or
```bash
Run_FragGeneScan.pl -genome=sequence.fq -out=output -complete=0 -train=sanger_10
```
Parameters:
- `-genome`: The name of your input sequence file in FASTA or fastq format.
- `-out`: The name of your output files (without extensions).
- `-complete`: 1 if the sequence data are complete genomic sequences (i.e., 1 sequence in a fasta file). 0 if otherwise (i.e., when you have many short sequence reads in a fasta/fastq file).
- `-train`: The name of the file containing model parameters.

In the above example, "sequence.fna" or "sequence.fq" is the input file. For `-complete=1` case, FragGeneScan uses a model trained from complete genomes; for `-complete=0` case, it uses a model trained from 454 pyro-sequencing reads (with about 10% sequencing errors). 

The output files will be as follows: 
- "output.fna" (sequence file in FASTA format).
- "output.faa" (protein sequence file in FASTA format).
- "output.out" (gene prediction result; similar format as Glimmer/MetaGene). 

Format Required:

FASTA file:

    >sequence1
    AGCTTGCTCGTAGCTGTCGTAGCTGAT

FastQ file:

    @sequence1
    AGCTTGCTCGTAGCTGTCGTAGCTGAT
    +
    !''*((((***+))%%%++)(%%%%).1***-+*''))**55CCF>>>>>>CCCCCCC65

Specifications in the Input Files:
- FastA file: The sequence ID is followed by the nucleotide sequences. They are separated by a newline.
- Fastq file: Each sequence has four lines. The first line starts with '@', followed by an optional description. The second line is the raw sequence letters. The third line, starts with by '+'. The fourth line encodes the quality values for the sequence in the second line, and must contain the same number of symbols as letters in the sequence. 

Note: Every line of the same sequence must be wrapped to the same length, though sequences can differ in length from each other.
