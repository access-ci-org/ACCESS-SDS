Use Case: XPMEM is a Linux kernel module for cross-environment process-to-process memory sharing. It is commonly used in high-performance scientific computing for enhancing performance by minimizing copying data between processes.

Code details and examples: Code. 

Firstly, let's define an abstract use-case where a process needs to share some memory with another process. 

In XPMEM, the process that shares its memory is the source process, and the process that takes the shared memory is a recipient process. 

In the source process, suppose we have an existing memory buffer that we want to share:

```cpp
char* buffer = new char[256]; 
strcpy(buffer, "Hello, XPMEM!");
```

To share this buffer, we need to get the XPMEM segment ID of the source process:

```cpp
xpmem_segid_t segid = xpmem_make(buffer, 256, XPMEM_PERMIT_MODE, (void*)0666);
```

In the recipient process, we need to receive the shared buffer. To do so, first, we need to get the XPMEM access permit ID:

```cpp
xpmem_apid_t apid = xpmem_get(segid, XPMEM_RDWR, XPMEM_PERMIT_MODE, NULL);
```

Then, we attach to the memory segment:

```cpp
void* attached = xpmem_attach(apid, 0, NULL);
```

Now, `attached` should contain "Hello, XPMEM!" from `buffer`. To detach, use:

```cpp
xpmem_detach(attached);
```

And to release the segment ID and access permit ID, use:

```cpp
xpmem_release(apid);
xpmem_remove(segid);
```

Shared memory should be released (and thus, become inaccessible) automatically when the source process ends.
