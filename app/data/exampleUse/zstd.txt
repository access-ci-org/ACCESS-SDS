Use Case: zstd, short for Zstandard, is a real-time compression algorithm designed to offer a high compression ratio and speed. Zstandard can be used to compress a file or a stream of data. It is most useful in scenarios where speed and high compression are needed, such as for backups, network transfers, or as a component in bigger systems to reduce their size.

Code Details and Examples:
Code:

To compress a file using zstd, you need a file as input. The command zstd accepts a file name as argument, and outputs a compressed file with the .zst extension.

Command to run:

```
 zstd file.txt
```

This will output a compressed file named file.txt.zst. 

To decompress a .zst file, use command unzstd or zstd -d . For instance:

```
unzstd file.txt.zst
```

or 

```
zstd -d file.txt.zst
```

Both commands will recreate the original file.txt from file.txt.zst. 

Zstandard also supports a variety of options to customize the execution, such as setting a specific compression level with the -# flag, where # is the compression level from 1 (fastest) to 19 (smallest). For example:

```
zstd -19 file.txt
```

This will compress file.txt using level 19, which provides a smaller output at the expense of speed.

Zstandard supports a wide range of file formats, without specific requirements for the input file's format or structure. Any binary or text file can be provided, and Zstandard will attempt to compress it. The input files do not require specific details or formats, other than being accessible by the zstd command.
