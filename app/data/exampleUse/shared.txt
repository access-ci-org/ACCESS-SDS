Use Case: Shared is a widely-used scientific computational library used for solving computational problems, particularly in the field of linear algebra. It can be used in conjunction with various programming languages such as C, C++, and Fortran.

Code Details and Examples: Code

C++ code using the shared library for solving a linear system of equations:

```C++
#include <iostream>
#include "shared.h"  // assuming that shared.h is in the current directory

int main() {
    std::vector<double> A = {1, 2, 3, 4}; // coefficients matrix
    std::vector<double> b = {5, 6};       // right-hand side vector
    std::vector<double> x;                // solution vector

    shared::linear_solve(A, b, x);        // call to subroutine in the shared library

    // print solution vector
    for (auto &i : x) {
        std::cout << i << ' ';
    }
    std::cout << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

The input files required for this example would be as follows:

shared.h
In this file, you would need to declare the linear_solve function which is part of the shared library and would have the prototype similar to the following.

```C++
#ifndef SHARED_H
#define SHARED_H

#include <vector>

namespace shared {
    void linear_solve(std::vector<double> A, std::vector<double> b, std::vector<double> &x);
}

#endif // SHARED_H
```

The format of the input files would be a standard header file (.h for C++) delineating the interface to the shared library. 

The command to run this code (assuming the program file is named main.cpp and that the shared library is already compiled and linked correctly) would be:

```bash
g++ -o main main.cpp -lshared
./main
``` 

This command first compiles the C++ code and links it against the shared library, it then runs the resulting executable file. The results will be printed to the console.
