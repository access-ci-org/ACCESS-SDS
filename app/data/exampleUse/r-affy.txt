Use Case: r-affy is widely used for analyzing Affymetrix GeneChip data in bioinformatics and genomics studies. This R package provides methods for background correction, quality control, normalization, summarization, and reporting of Affymetrix GeneChip expression microarrays.

Code details and examples:

- The basic format of input file is .CEL, which is the raw data file provided by Affymetrix microarrays.

- Individual files are separated in folders, and a specific path is used to access them.

Code:

```R
# Load the packages
library(affy)

# The path to the CEL files
path_to_data <- system.file("extdata", package="affydata")

# Read the CEL files into an AffyBatch object
celfiles <- list.celfiles(path_to_data)
dataABatch <- ReadAffy(celfiles=celfiles)

# Perform rma normalization
dataNorm <- rma(dataABatch)

# Getting expression values
expSet <- exprs(dataNorm)
```

Command to run: This code should be run line by line in the R environment, whether that's in RStudio, R command line, or another R environment. If the script is saved as a .R file, it can be run from the command line with: `Rscript my_script.R`- this requires that you have R installed on your command line and have properly set your PATH variables for R. 

Assuming you have a batch of .CEL files located in a directory on your computer, replace `path_to_data` with the path to those files. Please note that the code requires affy and affydata libraries to be installed in your R environment.
