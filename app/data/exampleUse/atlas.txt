Use Case: ATLAS (Automatically Tuned Linear Algebra Software) is a high-performance software library for linear algebra. It provides a mature set of BLAS APIs for performing basic linear algebra operations such as vector addition, scalar multiplication, dot products, matrix multiplication, and more. 

Code details and examples: 

Here is an example of using ATLAS to perform a basic linear algebra operation: matrix multiplication.

Sample Input Files: No specific input file. It generally takes the array and matrix for multiplication.

Format Required: As data is provided direct in the method call.

Specifications and Details in Input Files: NA

Code Snippet:

```c
#include "cblas.h"
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {

    /* Declare the matrices and vectors */
    double A[4] = {1,2,3,4};
    double B[4] = {5,6,7,8};
    double C[4] = {0,0,0,0};

    /* Perform the multiplication: C = A * B, where A, B, and C are matrices */
    cblas_dgemm(CblasRowMajor, CblasNoTrans, CblasNoTrans, 2, 2, 2, 1.0, A, 2, B, 2, 1.0, C, 2);

    /* Print the result */
    for(int i=0; i<4; i++) {
        printf("%f ", C[i]);
    }

    return 0;
}
```

Command to Run:

Compile the code with gcc and -lcblas flag:

```bash
gcc -o matrix_mult matrix_mult.c -lcblas
```

Then run the compiled executable:

```bash
./matrix_mult
```
