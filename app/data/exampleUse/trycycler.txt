Use Case: Trycycler is used for long-read de novo assembly reconciliation. It is often used in bioinformatics to reconcile multiple genome assemblies.

Code Details and Examples:

Code:

---An example of a TryCycler workflow---

1. Cluster: grouping together assemblies that are substantially similar.

```python
trycycler cluster --reads reads.fastq --assemblies assemblies/*.fasta --out_dir trycycler
```
i. Reads.fastq is the input file containing sequencing reads.
ii. assemblies/*.fasta contains all assembly outputs to compare, they should be complete circular genomes.
iii. trycycler is the output directory.

2. Reconcile: performs a multiple-sequence alignment for each cluster.

```python
trycycler reconcile --reads reads.fastq --reads2 reads.fastq --cluster_dir clusters/mash0.05_4 --threads 10 --out_dir reconcile
```
i. Reads.fastq, reads2.fastq are the input files containing sequencing reads. The first files contains forward reads. The second file contains reverse reads.
ii. clusters/mash0.05_4 is the directory of clusters output from the 'trycycler cluster' command.
iii. Reconcile is the output directory.
iv. threads 10, number of threads to use.

3. Consensus: uses the multiple-sequence alignment to create a consensus assembly.

```python
trycycler consensus --cluster_dir clusters/mash0.05_4 --msa_file msa.fasta --out_dir consensus
```
i. clusters/mash0.05_4 is the directory of clusters output from the 'trycycler cluster' command.
ii. msa is the multiple-sequence alignment file output from the 'trycycler reconcile' command.
iii. consensus is the output directory.
