Use Case: Cufflinks is used to assemble transcripts, estimate their abundances, and test for differential expression and regulation in RNA-Seq samples. It assembles aligned RNA-Seq reads into transfrags and quantifies their expression.

Code details and examples: 
Code:

Cufflinks accepts aligned RNA-Seq reads in SAM (Sequence Alignment/Map) or BAM (Binary Alignment/Map) format, preferentially sorted.

Input File Format: The input file should be in sorted SAM or BAM format. Here's an example of a SAM file:

```
@SQ SN:chr1 LN:249250621
@SQ SN:chr2 LN:243199373
r001   99  chr1  1000    60  50M =   10000   9058  ATTTAGCTCACTCTGTGTCACTTACACTGTGTCATTCACGTGTCGTGCT  +   100000
r002   73  chr2  2000    23  14M1D36M  *   0   0   ACTGACTGACTGACTGACTGACTGACTGACTGACTGACTG-CTGACTGACTG  E   720
```
Command to run:
```
cufflinks -p 8 -o /home/user/cufflinks_out /home/user/aligned_reads.bam
```
-p specifies the number of processor threads to use, -o specifies the output directory, and the final argument is the path to the SAM or BAM file.

In this example, Cufflinks will assemble the reads in the input file `aligned_reads.bam` and write the output files into the folder `cufflinks_out`.

Specifications and Details in Input Files:
The input file should contain aligned next-generation sequencing reads in BAM or SAM format. It is commonly sorted by coordinate or queryname. It could have been produced by a software like TopHat, Bowtie or BWA. 

Output Files: 
The main output of Cufflinks are .gtf files including `transcripts.gtf`, `isoforms.fpkm_tracking`, `genes.fpkm_tracking` and `skipped.gtf`. These files follow the `General Transfer Format (gtf)` and contain details of the assembled transcripts along with their expression measurements. An individual transcript report in a .gtf file looks like: 

```
chr1 Cufflinks  transcript  12010  13670  1000  +  . gene_id "CUFF.1"; transcript_id "CUFF.1.1"; FPKM "0.849679966182375"; frac "1.000000"; conf_lo "0.633337"; conf_hi "1.066020"; cov "0.055419";
```
This implies a transcript was found on chromosome 1, spanning base pair 12010 to 13670, with Normalised expression level of 0.8496 FPKM.
