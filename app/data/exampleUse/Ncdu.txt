Use Case: Ncdu (NCurse Disk Usage) is a command-line tool used to find the directories and files that take up the most disk space on a Unix-like operating system. It is designed to offer a fast way to scan the file system, and let the users browse the disk usage statistics in a friendly interface.

Code details and examples: Code 

Considering the root filesystem as an example:

Command to run ncdu:

```bash
ncdu /
```

In this case, the input is the path we want to scan, represented by "/". The tool then recursively scans the filesystem from that path, building up a representation of the disk usage of each file and directory.
After scanning, it presents an interactive interface where you can explore the directories that take up the most space.

Please note that running `ncdu` with a directory that contains many files can take a long time to finish as it needs to get the size for each file. This is true especially for '/'. A better use would be specifying a directory like `/var` instead of `/`

Please also note that you need the right permissions to inspect some directories. Running ncdu with superuser (sudo) permissions can check for these directories:

```bash
sudo ncdu /
```

But please be very careful when running commands with superuser permissions!
