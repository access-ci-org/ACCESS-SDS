Use Case: Lumpy-SV is a probabilistic framework for structural variant discovery, used in genomic studies and bioinformatics. It is designed to integrate multiple signals to be used to resolve the putative structure for a variant in genomic data. The input requires are a standard .bam alignment file and a .bedpe formatted breakpoint file. 

Code details and examples:

Code:

```bash
lumpyexpress -B sample.bam -S sample.splitters.bam -D sample.discordants.bam -o sample.vcf
```

`sample.bam` is the input file in BAM format, which contains sequence alignment data. The `sample.splitters.bam` and `sample.discordants.bam` are also BAM files that contain specific data needed by Lumpy such as split reads and discordant read pairs. The output is a vcf file `sample.vcf` which gives the details about the structural variants.

For the BAM file, an example entry could be:

```txt
EAS114_8:5:1:1820:104717#0    99  1   31765325  42  76M =   31765393  166 AGATGCTGGGATTACAGGCGTGAGCCACCACGCGCCCGGCC  AGAAGTTTA...

```

This entry gives details of the offset, alignment, and sequence of a read in the genomic data. Note: actual data is much longer and more complex.

The BEDPE file could have entries like:

```
chr1    1000    1001    chr1    5000    5001
```

This specifies a potential breakpoint where a structural variant may exist between the genomic data at positions 1001 and 5000 on chromosome 1. More complex structural variants will have multiple breakpoints.

It is essential that your input files are correctly formatted and extract the required data correctly. Improperly formatted or faulty input will likely result in errors or inaccurate results.
