Use Case: Use Comsol for solving partial differential equations (PDE) using finite element methods. It's extensively used in the field of engineering for simulations and modeling.

Code details and examples: Code 

The input file for Comsol is typically a .mph file, which is a binary file format that contains the model details, geometry, physics settings, study steps, and results. You cannot manually modify or create this file. However, it can be created using the Comsol User Interface, or by using a .m script file (Matlab script) via the Comsol API. 

Example: 

Consider a PDE in the form of a heat equation which states that the change in heat U in an object is a result of heat diffusion - 

∂U/∂t = ∇.([k*∇U] + Q)

where k is the diffusion coefficient and Q is the heat sources or sinks.

Creating the PDE in Comsol:

1. Define geometry. In this case, lets consider a 1D model with length as 1m. 

```code
model.geom('geom1').create('blk1', 'Block');
model.geom('geom1').feature('blk1').set('size', [1]);
model.geom('geom1').run('blk1');
```

2. Select the physics. In this case, let's use the heat transfer in solids.

```code
model.physics.create('ht', 'HeatTransfer', 'geom1');
```

3. Set the boundary conditions and values for k and Q. Here k is assumed to be 0.5 and Q as 500.

```code
model.physics('ht').feature('init1').set('Tinit', 500); 
model.physics('ht').feature('hs1').set('k_mat', 'userdef');
model.physics('ht').feature('hs1').set('k', 0.5);
model.physics('ht').feature('hs1').set('Q0_src', 'root.beam.Q_heat');
model.physics('ht').feature('hs1').set('Q0', 500);
```

To run the Comsol model, use the following command in Comsol runtime or use the GUI to run the simulation.

```code
model.study('std1').run;
```

Please note that these codes are ran on Comsol GUI or Comsol run-time after creating the "model" object.
