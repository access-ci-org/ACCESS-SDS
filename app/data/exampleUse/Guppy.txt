Use Case: Guppy is a basecaller software developed by the Oxford Nanopore Technologies for decoding raw signal data from nanopore sequencing into DNA sequences.

Code Details and Examples:

Code: 

For basecalling with Guppy, you'll need a FAST5 file (raw read input file) and a model file specific to the sequencing kit used. 

Here's an example of how you'd use Guppy:

```
guppy_basecaller -i /path/to/fast5/files -s /output/directory --flowcell FLO-PRO002 --kit SQK-DCS109
```

In this command:
- `-i` specifies the directory containing input Fast5 read files.
- `-s` specifies the directory where output files will be saved.
- `--flowcell` specifies the flow cell used - in this case, it's FLO-PRO002.
- `--kit` specifies the sequencing kit used - in this case, it's SQK-DCS109.

Note that the specific flowcell and kit options will depend on your specific experiment. Use `guppy_basecaller --help` to view possible options.

Your output will primarily be a `.fastq` file, containing the called sequences.
