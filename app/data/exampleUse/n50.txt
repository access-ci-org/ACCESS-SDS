Use Case: N50 is a statistic that is widely used to assess the quality of assemblies in the field of genomics. It measures the contiguity of a genome assembly. It is defined as the length of the shortest contig such that the sum of contigs of equal length or longer is at least 50% of the total length of all contigs.

Code details and examples: 
Code:

N50.py is a Python script that calculates N50 from a multi-FASTA-formatted file containing contigs from a genome assembly.

Command to run:

```
python N50.py inputfile.fasta
```

Input format:

The input file for N50.py is a FASTA file, which is a text-based format for representing nucleotide sequences or amino acid sequences. Each sequence in the FASTA format starts with a single-line description which is followed by lines of sequence data. The description line (defline) is distinguished from the sequence data by a greater-than (">") symbol in the first column. 

Here is a sample input file:

``` 
>contig00001 
GATGATTTAGCCGGTGCGTACATTTTGC
>contig00002
CGTACGTCGACGTCGACGTAGCTAGCTTGATTACGTAC
>contig00003
GATCGATCGATCGTAGCTACGTAGCATGCTAGCTAGC 
>contig00004 
ACTAGTAGCTAGCTAGCTGCTAGTAGCTAGCTATGC
```

This FASTA file contains sequences of four contigs. The first contig has a sequence "GATGATTTAGCCGGTGCGTACATTTTGC" and so on.

No specifications in the input file are required. However, the input file must be in the FASTA format.
