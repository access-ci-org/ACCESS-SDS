Use Case: Use R-bibtex to create bibliographies in R Markdown.

Code details and examples: Code

Sample input file:
```
---
title: "My Document"
output: pdf_document
bibliography: my_references.bib
---
```
In this case, the input file (a .bib file) consists of a collection of bibliography entries. Each entry includes information about a particular reference, including the author, title, year of publication, and so on.

Format required: .bib file
```
@article{smith2017,
 author = {John Smith},
 title = {Interesting Paper},
 journal = {The Journal of Interesting Papers},
 year = {2017},
 volume = {4},
 pages = {1--10}
}
```

Command to run the file:
```
rmarkdown::render("my_document.Rmd")
```
This command reads the .Rmd file, processes it, and outputs a PDF document with the bibliography included at the end.

Specifications and details in input files: In the .bib file, each bibliography entry starts with `@article` (or some other type), followed by an identifier in bracesâ€”this identifier is used to cite the reference in the .Rmd file (e.g., `[@smith2017]`). The citation information follows, with each piece of information separated by commas and included within braces.

Code Snippets: 
```{r}
# R Markdown
This is my paper. I cite [@smith2017].
```
This snippet includes a citation of the Smith (2017) paper in the text. R-bibtex will compile this citation and correctly format it in the final document based on the citation information included in the @smith2017 entry in the .bib file. The output will be a PDF document with the citation correctly formatted in the text and bibliography included at the end of the document.
