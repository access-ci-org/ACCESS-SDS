Use Case: Molden is a software package used by computational chemists to aid in the interpretation of quantum chemical calculations, visualize molecular orbitals, electron densities and molecular vibrations.

Code details and examples:

Code: 

Molden Files are the primary files that Molden uses. A sample Molden file for a molecule of water would look like:

[Atoms] Angs
O     1   8   0.000000   0.000000   0.000000
H     2   1   0.758602   0.000000   0.504284
H     3   1  -0.758602    0.000000   0.504284

The file lists the atom type, atom number, atomic number, and XYZ position of each atom in the molecule. More complex molecules would have more entries.

Command to Run: 
To visualize the molecular structure using Molden, you would use the command:

\molden <inputfile>

Where <inputfile> is the path and name of your molden file. This can be used in Windows, MAC, or on Unix/Linux with proper install. 

Afterwards, Molden presents you with a GUI from which you can interpret your quantum chemical calculations.
