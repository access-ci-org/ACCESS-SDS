Use Case: MethylDackel is used to process a sorted, indexed bam or cram file (from BSMAP or Bismark) in order to produce per-base methylation metrics. It also produces metrics aggregated by CpG methylation or across the entire genome. 

Code Details and Examples: Code 

Sample Input Files: sorted and indexed bam or cram files.

File Format Required: bam or cram.

Specifications and Detail in Input Files: Inputs must be PCR-duplicated marked reads from a Bisulfite-Seq experiment, in a bam or cram file format which has been sorted and indexed.

Example:
The input files should look like the following:
```
@HD     VN:1.6  SO:coordinate
@SQ     SN:chr1 LN:249250621
@SQ     SN:chr2 LN:243199373
...
@PG     ID:Bismark     VN:v0.22.1       CL:"bismark --bowtie2 ... "
```

Command to Run:
The basic command to run MethylDackel is:
```bash
MethylDackel extract -o output_prefix reference_genome.fa input.bam
```
Here, 'output_prefix' is the file name for the output files, 'reference_genome.fa' is the reference genome file, and 'input.bam' is the input sorted and indexed bam file.

This command will output multiple files with methylation metrics, including a bedGraph file with per-CpG methylation metrics. Specific options can be used for different requirements.

Note: You will need to replace 'output_prefix', 'reference_genome.fa', and 'input.bam' with your actual file names.
