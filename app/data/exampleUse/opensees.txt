Use Case: OpenSees (Open System for Earthquake Engineering Simulation) is an open-source software framework for conducting finite element simulations of structural and geotechnical systems subjected to earthquakes. The application allows users to build complex models using a simple scripting language. 

Code details and examples: 

Code:
```tcl
# This is your OpenSees script.
# create a simple 2 node system

model BasicBuilder -ndm 2 -ndf 3  

node 1   0.0 0.0
node 2  144.0 0.0 

fix 1 1 1 1
fix 2 0 1 0

uniaxialMaterial Elastic 1 3000.0
element truss 1 1 2 10.0 1

pattern Plain 1 "Series -dt 0.01 -filePath GM1.txt -factor 1.0" {
    load 2 1.0 0.0 0.0
}
```

This example TCL script creates a simple two-node model with a uniaxial elastic material. The nodes are fixed against movement in both the X and Y directions. The script also specifies a load pattern for the analysis, with a series from a file named "GM1.txt" scaled by a factor of 1. The load is applied to node 2 in the X direction.

The "GM1.txt" should be placed in the same directory as the TCL script. The GM1.txt file should contain a single column of values representing ground motion recordings.

To run this script, you would use the command:

`$ OpenSees <your_example_script.tcl>` 

The "<your_example_script.tcl>" should be replaced with the name of your TCL file. Your script and all needed files should be in the same working directory.
