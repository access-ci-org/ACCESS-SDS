Use Case: Use "qd" package which is a higher-performance alternative to "DoubleDouble" and "Real" libraries for extended precision calculations in computational mathematics, graphics, complex number evaluation and computer simulations. 

Code details and examples: Code 

Input file: Not applicable in this case as the "qd" library is used in code implementations to improve precision and performance. The library offers a set of arithmetic operations for computations with high precision, and not an executable software that runs using an input file.

```C++
#include <qd/qd_real.h>

int main() {
  qd_real a = sqrt(qd_real(2.0));
  qd_real b = pow(qd_real(10.0), 100);
  qd_real c = a * b;
  std::cout.precision(64);
  std::cout << "The result is " << c << std::endl;
  return 0;
}
```
This code calculates `sqrt(2.0)` and `pow(10.0, 100)`, multiplies them together and prints the result using high precision.

Command to run this code will depend on your compiler, for g++ compiler: g++ -I /path/to/qd/include -L /path/to/qd/lib main.cpp -lqd -o main && ./main
If path to header and library files of "qd" are already set in your environment variables, you can simply use: g++ main.cpp -lqd -o main && ./main

Please replace "/path/to/qd/include" and "/path/to/qd/lib" with the location of your "qd" library's header files and library files. The flag "-I" is used to include the "qd" library's header files and "-L" is used to specify the library files. "-lqd" is linking with the "qd" library and "-o main" is used to name your output executable "main". If the build is successful, "./main" runs the code.
