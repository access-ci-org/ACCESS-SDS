Use Case: The "vctrs" R-package is handy for creating and dealing with new vector classes. It is a part of the tidyverse ecosystem, and its routine revolve around vector classes. For example, it provides methods to combine vectors (unequal length recycling, list-columns), and to cast and coerce them.

Code details and examples:

Code:

```R
# Load the library
library(vctrs)

# Create a vector 
grades <- c("A", "B", "A", "B", "C")
class(grades)

# Convert to factor and then to ordered factor with vctrs package
grades_factor <- factor(grades, levels = c("A","B","C"))
grades_ord <- new_ordered(grades_factor)
  
grades_ord
```

Input files: Not applicable. Inputs provided directly within the code, no external files required. 

Format required: Not applicable, no specific format required given the nature of the vector data.

Specifications in input files: Not applicable, direct vector data manipulation in code, no external file input specifications.

Command to run: The R script can be run in RStudio or any R environment by selecting and running the script lines. No specific command to run is needed if you are in an R environment.
