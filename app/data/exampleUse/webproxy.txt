Use Case: A web proxy, such as Squid, might be used to control internet traffic, to speed-up access to websites by caching web pages or to monitor and log internet usage. 

Code details and examples: 

Code: The configuration file for Squid is typically located at /etc/squid/squid.conf

We will cover here an example to allow only specific sites and block all others:

1. First, you need to define an Access Control List (ACL) for the allowed websites. 

    acl allowed_sites dstdomain "/etc/squid/allowed_sites"

2. Next, you'll have to allow HTTP access for these sites

   http_access allow allowed_sites

3. And then deny all other HTTP traffic

   http_access deny all

In the "/etc/squid/allowed_sites" file, you'd enter the websites you want to allow. The format is one website per line, like so:

    google.com
    wikipedia.org

To run this you would then restart the squid service:

    sudo systemctl restart squid

Attention: The configuration file ("/etc/squid/squid.conf") must be edited as root and the path "/etc/squid/allowed_sites" might change depending on your installation. 

Note: be aware that changes in the configuration file are only applied after a restart of the service. Also, remember to check syntax and configuration with "squid -k parse" before restarting the service.
