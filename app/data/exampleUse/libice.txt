Use Case: Library for Inter-Client Exchange (libICE) is useful for maintaining session protocol between clients and the server in a network system. It allows multiple clients to communicate with each other and the server efficiently.  

Code Details and Examples: 

Code:
```c
#include <X11/ICE/ICElib.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    IceConn connection;
    char *networkId = "192.168.0.1"; // example network ID, you may change it
    // Initiate the connection to the ICE network
    connection = IceOpenConnection(networkId, NULL, False, 0, NULL);
    // Check if the connection is successful
    IceConnectStatus status;
    for (;;) {
        status = IceConnectionStatus(connection);
        if (status == IceConnectPending)
            continue;
        if (status == IceConnectAccepted) 
            printf("Connection established with ICE network.\n");
        else 
            printf("Failed to connect to ICE network.\n");
        break;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

Command to run the above ICElib C code will depend on the C compiler you are using, with gcc (GNU Compiler Collection):

```bash
gcc ice_example.c -lICE -lSM -o ice_example
./ice_example
```

The `-lICE` and `-lSM` flags are to link the code to ICElib and Session Management library respectively. The `ice_example.c` is the source code file name and `ice_example` is the output executable file.

There is no input file required for this as the program does not take any input from a file. It is a simple client connection initialization example. A real world example will have more specific to the system sender, listener and message details set up to use ICE protocol effectively.
