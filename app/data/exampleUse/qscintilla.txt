Use Case: QScintilla is a source code editing component that is used in IDEs and text editors, primarily for its syntax highlighting and code completion features. It is popular in Python oriented editors and is a part of the PyQt framework.

Code details and examples: After having imported QScintilla, you can use it to highlight syntax in a Qt widget.

Code:

```python
from PyQt5.Qsci import QsciScintilla, QsciLexerPython

editor = QsciScintilla()
lexer = QsciLexerPython()

editor.setLexer(lexer)
editor.setText('''
import os
import sys

def main():
    print('Hello, QScintilla')
    
if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
''')

editor.show()
```

In the script, a QScintilla editor widget is created, a lexer for highlighting Python syntax is set for it, and some sample Python code is fed into it.

The command to run this depends on your Python environment, but calling `python file.py` from the terminal, where `file.py` is the name of the file containing this script, should work in most cases. The QScintilla editor widget will display in a new window.

Specifications and details related to input files and format: The input of QScintilla comes directly from a string of code, as seen in the `editor.setText()`. Syntax highlighting depends on the lexer you set, in this case `QsciLexerPython`. There is no specific file format needed as inputs can be direct code strings.
