Use Case: Clip is a command-line clipboard utility that is used to manage the clipboard contents. It can be used to pipe the output of commands directly to the Windows clipboard.

Code details and examples:

Code:

To copy the contents of a file to the clipboard:
```
clip < filename.txt
```
This command will copy the contents of filename.txt to the clipboard.

To pipe the output of a command to the clipboard:
```
dir | clip
```
This command will list the contents of the current directory and copy the result to the clipboard.

Specifications and Details in Input Files: Clip does not require any input files. The input is provided directly from the command line or piped from the output of another command. 

Format required: Since the input is taken from the command line, there is no required format. The input can be any text or output from any command.

Command to run them: The commands are run directly from the Windows command prompt. The format is "clip < input" to copy a file's contents to the clipboard, or "command | clip" to pipe the output of a command to the clipboard. In these examples, "input" is the name of the file to copy, and "command" is any command whose output you want to copy.
