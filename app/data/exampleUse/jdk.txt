Use Case: JDK (Java Development Kit) is a software development environment used for creating Java applications and applets. It includes the Java Runtime Environment (JRE), an interpreter (JVM - Java Virtual Machine), a compiler (javac), an archiver (jar), and other tools needed in Java development.

Code details and examples:

Code:

```java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```

The above example is a simple Java code saved as .java file that prints "Hello, World!" when run.

To compile and run this Java file in the Terminal (command-line), first navigate to the directory where the .java file is saved. The file should be saved with a .java extension.

Then, use the following command to compile:
```shell
javac HelloWorld.java
```

This will create a HelloWorld.class file, the bytecode equivalent of your Java code. 

Finally, use the following command to execute:
```shell
java HelloWorld
```

If the code executes without any errors, "Hello, World!" will be printed on the Terminal.
