Use Case: Dask is used for parallel computing in Python. It provides advanced parallelism directly into native Python APIs like Numpy, Pandas, and Scikit-Learn. It enables efficient computation on large datasets that do not fit into memory.

Code details and examples:

Code:

```python
import dask.array as da

# Create a 10000x10000 array of random numbers, represented as many small arrays
array = da.random.random((10000, 10000), chunks=(1000, 1000))

# Now operate on this array as you would a numpy array
result = array + array.T

# Call .compute() when you want your result as a NumPy array.
total = result.mean().compute()
```
In this code, we are creating a large array that is split into smaller chunks, and performing some computations. The `compute()` function is used to get the result.

Command to run:

To run this script, save it as a .py file and use the Python interpreter from the terminal:

```bash
$ python dask_example.py
```

Command to run Dask interactively (Jupyter notebook or Python shell):

```bash
from dask.distributed import Client, progress
client = Client(processes=False)  # Start Dask Client

# Now use Dask as normally done.
```
