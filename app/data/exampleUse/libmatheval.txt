Use Case: Libmatheval is a library designed for parsing and evaluating mathematical expressions. It allows users to build their own symbolic or numerical calculations for scientific and engineering purposes.

Code details and examples: Code

INPUT FILES: There are no input files required for libmatheval. The functions and expressions are directly written into your C/C++ code.

FORMAT REQUIRED: Libmatheval uses standard algebraic notation for mathematical expressions, such as "+" for addition, "-" for subtraction, "*" for multiplication, "/" for division, and "^" for exponentiation. Function calls and variable names are also permitted.

SPECIFICATIONS AND DETAILS IN INPUT FILES: Since there are no input files required, this section is not applicable. 

CODE SNIPPETS:

Here is an example code snippet which parses and evaluates a mathematical expression using libmatheval:

```C
#include <matheval.h>
void * evaluator;
double x = 5.0, y = 3.0;
double result;
const char *expression = "3*x^2 + 2*y + 1";

// Initialize evaluator
evaluator = evaluator_create(expression);

// Set variables
evaluator_set_variable(evaluator, "x", x);
evaluator_set_variable(evaluator, "y", y);

// Evaluate expression
result = evaluator_evaluate(evaluator, 0, NULL);

// Destroy evaluator
evaluator_destroy(evaluator);
```

In this example, the mathematical expression is "3*x^2 + 2*y + 1", where x=5 and y=3. The result of evaluating this expression is stored in the variable "result". 

COMMAND TO RUN THEM:

To compile and run a program using libmatheval, you would use gcc and pass in the necessary flags. For example:

```bash
gcc -o calc calc.c -lmatheval
./calc
```

Here, "calc.c" is the name of your C/C++ code file and "calc" is the name of the output executable file. The flag "-lmatheval" tells the compiler to link against the libmatheval library.
