Use Case: iGenomes
Code details and examples: 

iGenomes provides genome sequences and annotation files for various organisms that are commonly used in genomics research. The data is typically organized in a specific directory structure with files in formats such as FASTA for sequences and GTF/GFF for annotations.

Example input files:
1. Genome sequence FASTA file (e.g., hg38.fa)
2. Annotation GTF file (e.g., hg38.gtf)

Data specifications:
- FASTA file: Contains the genomic sequences in the ATCG format.
- GTF file: Contains the genomic annotation information such as gene locations, transcript structures, and other features.

Command to retrieve iGenomes data:
iGenomes provides data for download from the Illumina iGenomes website. Download the data for the organism of interest and utilize it in your analysis pipelines.
