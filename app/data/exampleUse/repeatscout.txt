Use Case: RepeatScout is used for identifying repetitive sequences in genomic data. It's especially useful in studying genomes where the set of repeats is not completely known.

Code details and examples:

Code: 

1. Firstly, you need to create a sequence file. An example of a sequence file is given below:

```bash
>sequence1
CGAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTA
>sequence2
TCGATCGATCGATCGATCGATCGATCGATCGATCGA
```

Save this in a file named `input.fasta`.

2. The next step is to execute RepeatScout on the sequence file. Use the following command:

```bash
RepeatScout -sequence input.fasta -output output.repeats
```

In this command, `input.fasta` is the input sequence file you generated, and `output.repeats` is where the results will be saved.

3. An example output looks like this:

```bash
>RepeatScout_family-0
GCCGCGCGGCCGCCGCC.
>RepeatScout_family-1
ATCGATCGATCGATCGA.
```

Each line starting with `>` indicates a different repeat family discovered in the genome. The line after indicates the repeat sequence. 

Please, note that RepeatScout does not provide any further specifications for input files, it simply requires a file of sequences in FASTA format.
