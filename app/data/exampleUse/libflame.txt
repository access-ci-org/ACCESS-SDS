Use Case: libflame is a high-performance library for dense matrix computations providing a complete LAPACK API. It can be used for scenarios such as solving systems of linear equations, least-squares solutions of linear systems of equations, eigenvalue problems, and singular value problems.

Code Details and Examples: 

The typical input for libflame operations are matrix data. The library has in-built functions for handling matrix data and operations.

In order to use this library, we first include the necessary header file:

```c
#include "FLAME.h"
```

The following is an example for creating a simple matrix and performing an operation on it:

```c
FLA_Obj_create( FLA_DOUBLE, m, n, 0, 0, &A );
FLA_Random_matrix( A );
```

Here we are creating a matrix `A` of size `m` x `n` with double data type and filling it with random values.

An operation like LU factorization with partial pivoting can be performed with:

```c
FLA_Obj_create( FLA_INT, n, 1, 0, 0, &p );
FLA_LU_piv( A, p ); 
```

Here, a matrix `p` is created to store the pivot indices for the LU factorization.

Similarly, operations like Singular value decomposition can be performed with:

```c
FLA_Obj_create( FLA_DOUBLE, minmn, 1, 0, 0, &s );
FLA_Obj_create( FLA_DOUBLE, m, n, 0, 0, &U );
FLA_Obj_create( FLA_DOUBLE, minmn, n, 0, 0, &V );
FLA_SVD( A, s, U, V );
```

This creates matrices `s`, `U`, `V` to store the singular values and singular vectors respectively after the SVD operation.

To compile and run the code, use commands like:

```shell
gcc -o example example.c -lflame -lblas
./example
```

This will compile the source code file `example.c` with libflame and, the given BLAS library and create the executable `example`, which can then be run.
