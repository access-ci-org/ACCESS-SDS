Use Case: NextPolish is a useful tool for genome assembly and polishing. It uses both ONT and Illumina reads and employs an iterative correction mode that gradually improves the accuracy of assembly.

Code Details and Examples:

Code:

The input files for NextPolish include:
1. The draft genome assembly in FASTA format.
2. The short reads in FASTQ format.
3. The long reads in FASTQ format.

The command line to run with NextPolish is generally as follow:

```
nextPolish1 sgs_options.cfg
```

NextPolish needs a specific config file (sgs_options.cfg), below is an example:

```
[sgs_option]
sgs_fofn = ./input.fofn
genome = ./input.genome.fa
rounds = 2
sgs_options = -max_depth 100
job_type = local
job_prefix = nextPolish
task = 121151
rewrite =yes
rerun = 3
help = full 
```

Where:
- sgs_fofn is a text file containing the path to your short reads (Illumina) data. 
- genome is the path to your draft assembly.
- rounds is the number of times to iterate the correction. 
- sgs_options are the options to pass to minimap2 when aligning the short reads to the draft genome. For example, max_depth 100 will limit the depth of sequencing to avoid wasting time on super deep regions.
- The other options control job handling and whether to overwrite or retry failed jobs.

The output of NextPolish includes:
- The polished genome assembly in FASTA format.
