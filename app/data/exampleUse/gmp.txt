Use Case: The GMP (GNU Multiple Precision) library is a C library for arbitrary precision arithmetic, operating on signed integers, rational numbers, and floating-point numbers. GMP is extremely efficient for large operands. It's typically used for cryptographic or numerical applications, such as implementing cryptographic algorithms or large number factorization.

Code details and examples:

Code:

The GMP library supports numbers with practically no limit (only limited by available memory). Here is a simple example of how to add and multiply arbitrarily large integers.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <gmp.h>

int main (void)
{
  mpz_t a, b, c;  /* working variables */
  mpz_init (a);  /* initialize a, b and c */
  mpz_init (b);
  mpz_init (c);

  mpz_set_str (a, "123456789012345678901234567890", 10);  /* Base 10 */
  printf ("a = ");
  mpz_out_str (stdout, 10, a);  /* print a in base 10 */
  printf ("\n");

  mpz_set_str (b, "987654321098765432109876543210", 10);  /* Base 10 */
  printf ("b = ");
  mpz_out_str (stdout, 10, b);  /* print b in base 10 */
  printf ("\n");

  mpz_add (c, a, b);  /* c = a + b */
  printf ("c = ");
  mpz_out_str (stdout, 10, c);  /* print c in base 10 */
  printf ("\n");

  mpz_mul (c, a, b);  /* c = a * b */
  printf ("c = ");
  mpz_out_str (stdout, 10, c);  /* print c in base 10 */
  printf ("\n");

  mpz_clear (a);  /* free the memory used by a, b and c */
  mpz_clear (b);
  mpz_clear (c);

  return 0;
}
```

This program adds and multiplies large numbers. The mpz_set_str function is used to set the initial values of the numbers, indicating the base (10 in this case). The mpz_add and mpz_mul functions perform the arithmetic operations.

To compile and run the program, you'd typically do something like this at the command line (assuming the code is in a file named main.c and gcc is available):

```bash
gcc -o main main.c -lgmp
./main
```
