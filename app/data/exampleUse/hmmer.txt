Use Case: HMMER is used for searching sequence databases for homologs of protein sequences, and for making protein sequence alignments. 

Code details and examples:
Code:

To run an HMMER search, you need to specify the query sequence and the database to be searched. Query sequences are provided in FASTA format. A typical command might look like this:

```
hmmscan --tblout results.txt Pfam-A.hmm seqs.fasta
```

Here, `hmmscan` is the command to run the search, `--tblout results.txt` specifies that the output should be written to the file `results.txt`, `Pfam-A.hmm` is the database to search, and `seqs.fasta` is the file containing the query sequences.

The input file (`seqs.fasta`) might look like this:

```
>sequence1

FMLESLDSDYSLKGDIGSREKAKFAAELGIPFLETSAKTRQGVEDAFYTLVREIRLH
```

This is a standard FASTA format, with each sequence preceded by a line starting with a `>` character, which specifies the sequence identifier, and followed by the sequence itself. Multiple sequences can be included in the same file.

As for the `Pfam-A.hmm` file, it would contain a collection of HMM profiles. This could be downloaded from online protein databases like Pfam.
