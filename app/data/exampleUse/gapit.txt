Use Case: Use gapit software for genome-wide association studies in R. It's used to find associations between genetic markers (like single nucleotide polymorphisms, or SNPs) and traits of interest.

Code details and examples:

Input file:

The phenotypic data, genotypic data and map files are required. 

The data files are imported as CSV or TXT format.

Phenotypic data file would be a CSV where each line represents a different individual, and columns represent different traits. The first column should be a unique identifier for each individual. 

Example: 
ID, height, weight
ind1,1.8,80
ind2,1.6,60

The genotypic file would be a CSV where each line represents a different individual, and each column represents a different genetic marker. The first column should be a unique identifier for each individual. 

Example:
ID, snp1, snp2
ind1, 0, 2
ind2, 2, 2

Map file would be a three column CSV which includes chromosome, SNP and genetic position. 

example
chromosome, SNP, genetic position
1, snp1, 1.23
1, snp2, 1.56

Code:

# Load necessary libraries
library(GAPIT)

# Import data
myY <- read.csv("phenotypic_data.csv")
myGM <- read.csv("genotypic_data.csv")
myM <- read.csv("map.csv")

# perform GWAS using mixed linear model
myGAPIT <- GAPIT(Y=myY, GD=myGM, GM=myM)

Command:
Run from R after loading the library using library(GAPIT).
