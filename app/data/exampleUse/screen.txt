Use Case: GNU Screen is a terminal multiplexer, this allows a user to access multiple separate terminal sessions inside a single terminal window or remote terminal session. It can be used for terminal multiplexing, shells, logins, logouts, commands, and sessions for applications.

Code Details and Examples: 

Code: 

To create a new session:

```
screen -S my_session
```
In the above command, 'my_session' is the name of the session that is used for future references.

To list all the current sessions:

```
screen -ls
```

To re-attach a detached session:

```
screen -r my_session
```

Inside a screen session, typing Ctrl + a, followed by ? will bring up an extensive help page. 

The command 'Ctrl-a' 'Ctrl-d' will detach a screen session while leaving it running. This is handy for long-running process that you want to check back in on periodically.

To kill all the detached screen sessions:

```
screen -X quit
```

To split the screen vertically:

```
Ctrl-a |
```

To navigate between the splits:

```
Ctrl-a Tab
```

These commands often come handy when working on a remote machine, doing long calculations, working with many terminals simultaneously, and many more.
