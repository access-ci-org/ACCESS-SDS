Use Case: NextDenovo is a HPC software package. It's used for de novo genome assembly using long reads, like PacBio or Oxford Nanopore. It has a particular focus on assembling large genomes. 

Code Details and Examples:

The primary input for NextDenovo is a sequencing read file, often in a format like fastq. 

For example, your file might look something like this:

```
@SEQ_ID
GATCGGAAGAGCGGTTCAGCAGGAATGCCGAGACCGATCTCGTATGCCGT
+
!''*((((***+))%%%++)(%%%%).1***-+*''))**55CCF>>>>>>CCCCCCC65
```

In this example, `@SEQ_ID` is a header that gives some information about the read. The first line is the actual sequence, and the second line, which begins with a plus, is a quality score for each base in the sequence. 

To use NextDenovo, you need to direct it to a `run.cfg` config file, which will tell it where to find the input files and how to run the assembly. 

This might look something like:

```
[General]
job_type = local
job_prefix = nextDenovo
task = all
rewrite = yes
rerun = 3
parallel_jobs = 20
multithread_jobs = 5
genome_size = auto
seed_cutoff = 32332

[correct_option]
read_cuoff = auto
seed_cutoff = auto
blocksize = 1g
pa_correction = 2
sort_options = -m 1g -t 10 -k 40
minimap2_options_raw = -x ava-ont -t 10

[assemble_option]
random_round = 10
minimap2_options_cns = -x ava-ont -t 10
nextgraph_options = -a 1
```

A very simple command to run NextDenovo might look like:

```
nextDenovo run.cfg
```

In this command, `run.cfg` is the name of your config file. 

Note: It's important to remember that this is a high performance computing tool, and should be run on an appropriate infrastructure. The example provided here is for a local run, meaning it's set up to run on the machine it's being executed on, using its own resources. To run this on a shared infrastructure, like a computing cluster, the options will need to be adjusted accordingly.
