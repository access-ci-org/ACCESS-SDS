Use Case: Developing an application or a software using Java language to perform a specific operation.

Code details and examples: 

Code:

```java    
    public class Main {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            System.out.println("Hello, World!");
        }
    }
```

Above is a basic Java program. In Java, every application begins with a class name, and the program execution begins with the 'main' method. A Java program can contain multiple classes. In this code snippet, Main is the class name and it contains a single public class (the 'Main' class). The 'System.out.println' statement is used to print out the text "Hello, World!" on the screen.

File Format Required: Java Source Files (*.java).

Specifications in Input Files: The code must be written in correct Java syntax. Depending on the use case, the necessary libraries must be imported. A Java program starts executing from the 'main' method.

Command to Run: To compile and run the Java program, firstly compile it to bytecode (.class files) using the 'javac' (Java compiler) command, then run it using the 'java' command.

```bash   
    javac Main.java
    java Main
```
