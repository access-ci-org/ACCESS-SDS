Use Case: Quantum ESPRESSO
Code details and examples:
Sample input files for Quantum ESPRESSO typically include input files with parameters specified for calculations such as geometry optimization, energy minimization, and electronic structure calculations.

An example input file `input.in` for a geometry optimization calculation using Quantum ESPRESSO:

```
&control
    calculation = 'relax'
    prefix = 'al'
/
&system
    ibrav = 0
    nat = 2
    ntyp = 1
    ecutwfc = 30
/
&electrons
/
ATOMIC_SPECIES
Al 26.98 Al.pbe-mt_fhi.UPF
ATOMIC_POSITIONS { angstrom }
Al 0.0 0.0 0.0
Al 0.0 0.0 2.0
CELL_PARAMETERS { angstrom }
3.0 0.0 0.0
0.0 3.0 0.0
0.0 0.0 6.0
K_POINTS { automatic }
4 4 4 1 1 1
```

To run Quantum ESPRESSO with this input file, you would typically use a command like:
```
pw.x < input.in > output.out
```

Please note that the input file format and specific parameters may vary depending on the type of calculation being performed in Quantum ESPRESSO.
