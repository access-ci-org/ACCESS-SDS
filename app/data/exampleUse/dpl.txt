Use Case: DPL (Definitive Programming Language) is a powerful simulation modeling language with an integrated environment that provides the tools to complete a wide range of simulation model development tasks. With DPL, you can quickly and efficiently develop models that provide clear insight into complex, real-world problems.

Code details and examples:

Code:

This is a DPL Code for running the optimal timing of a single exploration well.

```
decision Drilling_Decision 'Drilling Decision'= {Drill, Not Drill};

chance Initial_Tests 'Initial Tests' = {Promising, Not Promising};

chance Detailed_Tests 'Detailed Tests' = {Promising, Not Promising};

chance Drilling_Outcome 'Drilling Outcome' = {Discovery, Dry Hole};

sequence Timing_Sequence 'Timing Sequence'= Interest_Rate_Forecast;

value Discovery_Value 'Discovery Value';

value Cost_of_Detailed_Survey 'Cost of Detailed Survey'=10;
value Cost_of_Drill 'Cost of Drill'=30;

Drilling_Decision = {simulate}

Initial_Tests = 
{	Promising	0.6,
Not Promising	0.4*Initial_Tests.True};

Detailed_Tests = 
{	Promising	0.8*Initial_Tests.Promising,
Not Promising	1-Initial_Tests.Promising*Detailed_Tests.Promising};

Drilling_Outcome =
{	Discovery	 	0.4*Detailed_Tests.Promising + 0.2*(1-Detailed_Tests.Promising),
Dry Hole	 	1-Drilling_Outcome.Discovery};

Timing_Sequence = 
{	Interest_Rate_Forecast,
	Drilling_Decision after Interest_Rate_Forecast,
	Initial_Tests after Drilling_Decision.Drill,
	Detailed_Tests after Initial_Tests.Promising,
	Drilling_Outcome after Drilling_Decision.Drill };

Discovery_Value = 80*Drilling_Outcome.Discovery;

Cost_of_Detailed_Survey = 10*Detailed_Tests.Promising;

Cost_of_Drill= 30*Drilling_Decision.Drill;

To run this file, you need to use the operations research software that supports DPL, such as Syncopation Software. Because DPL is used in Syncopation software you don't technically run a command to execute it.
