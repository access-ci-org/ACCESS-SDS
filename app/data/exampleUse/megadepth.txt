Use Case: Use MegaDepth -a versatile bioinformatics tool for generating high-quality coverage maps from sequencing data. It supports BAM and CRAM files with or without an index. 

Code details and examples:

- **Code**
```bash
megadepth sample.bam --out sample_output
```

- **Input format required**: Binary Alignment Map (BAM) or CRAM file.

- **Specifications and details in input files**: The input should be BAM or CRAM file representing reads alignments against a reference genome.

- **Command to run the script**: Use the command 'megadepth <input.bam> --out output'. 

Before running 'megadepth', BAM or CRAM file should be indexed using SAMtools if it is not.

```bash
samtools index sample.bam
```

- **Sample input file**
A file sample.bam containing binary sequence alignment data.
