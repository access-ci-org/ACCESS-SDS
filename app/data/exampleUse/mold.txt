Use Case: MOLD is a HPC software package that is primarily used for ab initio quantum chemistry calculations. It is capable of carrying out a variety of electronic structure methods such as Hartree-Fock, Density Functional Theory (DFT), and various post Hartree-Fock methods. 

Code details and examples: 

For the input file, it usually requires a ".inp" file. This is a text file which includes details of the molecule for which the calculations are to be done along with any other specifications for the calculation method, basis set, and other settings.

Example input file (filename: benzene.inp):

```
#Mold Input
#This is a sample calculation for Benzene molecule
start benzene

#Method specification
HF/STO-3G

#Geometry specification
geometry = C 0.00000 1.40272 0.00000 
           C 1.21479 0.70136 0.00000 
           C 1.21479 -0.70136 0.00000 
           C 0.00000 -1.40272 0.00000 
           C -1.21479 -0.70136 0.00000
           C -1.21479 0.70136 0.00000
           H 0.00000 2.49029 0.00000
           H 2.15666 1.24515 0.00000
           H 2.15666 -1.24515 0.00000
           H 0.00000 -2.49029 0.00000
           H -2.15666 -1.24515 0.00000
           H -2.15666 1.24515 0.00000
      
end
```
In this example, the molecule is benzene and the method used is Hartree-Fock with a STO-3G basis set. The geometry is then specified (in XYZ format).

After you have your input file ready, usually you will run the program with a command in the terminal that might look something like this:

```
mold benzene.inp
```

This command tells the MOLD program to read the input file "benzene.inp" and perform the calculations specified in it. The results are then usually printed to the screen or to a separate output file. Due to the high computational demands, these calculations are often run on HPC clusters.
