Use Case: LTR_FINDER is a software used for finding long terminal repeat retrotransposons (LTRâ€“RTs) in genomic sequences. It works by finding LTR pairs and the target site duplication signature. This can be used in genomics and bioinformatics studies, such as studying the evolution and dynamics of LTR retrotransposons within a genome.

Code details and examples:

Code:

File Requirements:

- LTR_FINDER requires a single input file, typically a FASTA-formatted file containing the genome sequence to be analyzed.

- Sample Input:
```
>NM_001282543.1 Homo sapiens homeobox A9 (HOXA9), transcript variant 2, mRNA
ATGGGCGACGAGGCGGCGGCGGGGATGAAGGAGGCGGCGGCGGCGGCGGCGAAAGAAGATGAAGGTG
TTCTGTTTTGGAACGGAAGGTGCTGGAATTTTTTGGAATTACCAGATATGGAATGAATATTGGGAAGG
```

Command to Run the Software:
After you have the sequence data file ready, navigate to the directory of LTR_FINDER and run the following command:
```bash
ltr_finder sequence.fasta
```
Replace "sequence.fasta" with the name of your FASTA file. 

This will produce an output file in the same directory where the program was run, with LTR retrotransposons in the genome sequence identified.

Code Snippets:
LTR_FINDER does not typically involve writing custom code snippets, as it is a complete program run from the command line with user-supplied parameters. If you were to automate or customize the workflow involving LTR_FINDER, it would typically involve bash or perl scripts using the command line interface from above.
