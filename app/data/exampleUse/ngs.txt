Use Case: Analysis of Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) data; 

Software: SAMtools, Bedtools, BCFtools mainly used in NGS data analysis; 

Code details and examples: 
Firstly, SAMtools, Bedtools, BCFtools need to be installed and available in your PATH. The bash command 'which' or 'command -v' can test if software is in the PATH.
```
which samtools bedtools bcftools
```
Should return something like 
```
/usr/local/bin/samtools
/usr/local/bin/bedtools
/usr/local/bin/bcftools
```
These software tools accept a variety of file formats, but mainly the SAM/BAM/CRAM for aligned sequencing data and VCF/BCF for variant calling data.

The file formats consist of header section and data section. The SAM/BAM/CRAM formats include fields like read name, flag, reference, read sequence, base quality, and so on. The VCF/BCF formats include fields like reference, position, ID, reference base, alternate base, quality, filter, information, format, sample level data, and so on.

A simple example to use SAMtools to view BAM file (replace 'example.bam' with your actual file):
```
samtools view example.bam | head -n 10
```
A simple example to use Bedtools to get the genome coverage from a BAM file:
```
bedtools genomecov -ibam example.bam -bg > example.bedgraph
```
A simple example to use BCFtools to view VCF file (replace 'example.vcf' with your actual file):
```
bcftools view example.vcf | head -n 10
```

Note: It assumes the input files are SAM/BAM/CRAM for aligned sequencing data or VCF/BCF for variant calling data. The files are under the right format, and 'head -n 10' here is just used to limit the output lines for demonstration.
