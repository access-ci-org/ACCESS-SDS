Use Case: Solve a system of linear equations using the netlib library, particularly LAPACK's dgesv routine.

Code details and examples: 

Code Example: 
This example assumes you are using Fortran programming language:

``` foralltran
    program solve
        implicit none
        ! Using dgesv from Lapack
        integer, parameter :: n = 3
        integer :: info
        integer :: ipiv(n)
        real(8) :: A(n,n), B(n)
        A = reshape([1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 4, 3, 4, 3], [n, n])  ! Coefficient matrix
        B = [3, 8, 11]  ! Right-hand side vector
        call dgesv(n, 1, A, n, ipiv, B, n, info)  ! Solve AX=B
        print*, B  ! Solution vector
    end program solve
```
Sample input files and format required: As shown in the example above, the input arguments of the dgesv subroutine include matrix A and matrix B, permutations ipiv and dimension n. The input data is hard-coded directly in the Fortran program.

Command to run: `gfortran solve.f90 -llapack && ./a.out`
