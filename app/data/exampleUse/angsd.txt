Use Case: ANGSD is a software package that allows you to analyze next-generation sequencing data. It can be used to estimate allele frequency, perform association mapping, estimate genetic diversity and inbreeding coefficients, perform principal component analysis, and more.

Code details and examples: Code

The input format required by ANGSD are BAM files, which contain sequence alignment data.

Here is a simple example of an ANGSD command, which will estimate the allele frequency spectrum and generate a beagle file:

```
angsd -bam bam.filelist -GL 1 -doMajorMinor 1 -doMaf 1 -SNP_pval 1e-6 -minMapQ 30 -minQ 20 -minInd 10 -doGeno 32 -doPost 1 -out output -P 4
```

This command takes the following input:

- bam.filelist: This is a file containing a list of BAM files to analyze.
- -GL 1: This sets the genotype likelihood model to the SAMtools model.
- -doMajorMinor 1: This tells ANGSD to infer the major and minor alleles from the data.
- -doMaf 1: This tells ANGSD to estimate the allele frequencies.
- -SNP_pval 1e-6: This sets the p-value cutoff for calling SNPs.
- -minMapQ 30: This sets the minimum mapping quality required to consider a read.
- -minQ 20: This sets the minimum basing quality required to consider a base.
- -minInd 10: This tells ANGSD to only use sites where at least 10 individuals have data.
- -doGeno 32: This tells ANGSD to output genotype likelihoods.
- -doPost 1: This tells ANGSD to calculate posterior probabilities.
- -out output: This specifies the output file prefix.
- -P 4: This tells ANGSD to use 4 threads.

Before running this command, you must prepare your bam.filelist. It should contain one path to a BAM file per line, like so:

```
/sample1.bam
/sample2.bam
/sample3.bam
```

Replace /sample1.bam, /sample2.bam etc with the actual full paths to your BAM files.
