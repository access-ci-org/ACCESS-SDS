Use Case: Use BiocGenerics for basic functions and types common to bioinformatics, genomics, and experimental data analysis.

Code details and examples: Code

In R:
```r
# Import BiocGenerics package
library("BiocGenerics")

# Demonstrate show method
setClass("track", representation(chrom="character", pos="numeric"))
show(getClass("track"))
```
The example sets up a class "track" with fields "chrom" and "pos". It then uses the "show" method to output the class structure.

To run the code, simply execute the R script file in your R environment.
