Use Case: Rhtslib is an R package which provides streaming access to high-throughput sequencing data. It allows for reading of BAM, Cram and Tabix file formats.

Code details and examples: Code

To use Rhtslib, it is necessary to have an existing file in these formats. Here's an example of working with a BAM file:

First, you need to import the library:
```
library(Rhtslib)
```

Then, you will initialize a BAM file. Suppose we have a BAM file named 'file.bam':
````
bam <- Rhtslib::BamFile("file.bam")
```

To fetch a specific region from the BAM file:
```
records <- scanBam(bam,
                   param=ScanBamParam(which=GRanges("chr1", IRanges(100, 200))))
```

Where: 
- `chr1` is the region of the genome you want to fetch
- `IRanges(100, 200)` specifies to extract the reads that overlaps with positions 100 to 200 in chr1.

So, in this case, command to run file: A Shell or Terminal emulator (Bash, ZSH, etc.), with The R Interpreter (`Rscript`) installed.

The above script is purely an R script, so it could be saved into a .R file and run from a terminal like so:
```
Rscript script.R
```

Bear in mind it's assumed "script.R" is the file name you stored the script into.
