Use Case: DNA Copy Number Variations (CNV) analysis on whole genome sequencing. It is used to predict copy number aberrations (deletions, amplifications, LOH, BAF, ploidy, genotypes) from deep sequencing data.

Code Details and Examples: Code.

Input File Format Required: 
Control-FREEC requires two types of input files: the file(s) with reads and the file describing the chromosome lengths.
  
  A sample of config file:

           [general]
           chrFiles = /path/ChrFiles
           ploidy = 2
           breakPointType = 2
           chrLenFile = /path/human_g1k_v37_chr.len
           window = 0
           telocentromeric = 0
           maxThreads = 4
           BedGraphOutput = TRUE
           
           [sample]
           mateFile = /path/WES1.bam
           inputFormat = BAM
           mateOrientation = FR
          
           [control]
           mateFile = /path/germline.bam
           inputFormat = BAM
           mateOrientation = FR

  Save the above configuration in a text file, e.g., "config_WES1.txt".
  Then, run:

        freec -conf config_WES1.txt

  The input file "human_g1k_v37_chr.len" can be downloaded from the Control-FREEC website or be generated. It has the format as in the following example:

        chr1    249250621
        chr2    243199373
        chr3    198022430
        chr4    191154276
        chr5    180915260
        chr6    171115067

  The "ChrFiles" folder should contain chromosome fasta files, e.g.,

        /path/ChrFiles/chr1.fa
        /path/ChrFiles/chr2.fa
        ...

  The results can be viewed in a genome browser, e.g., IGV, after converting them into BedGraph format. You can generate the BedGraph file by enabling "BedGraphOutput" in the configuration file.

  freec2bedgraph Rscript script should be used for normalization and color visualization for normal and tumor sample:

       Rscript freec2bedgraph.R sample.bam_CNVs.p.value.txt

  After that, the file sample.bam_CNVs.p.value.bedGraph can be uploaded into UCSC Genome Browser (use no header lines).
