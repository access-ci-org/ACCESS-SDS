Use Case: TRUST4 is an improved version of TRUST3 and used for finding the TCR (T-cell receptor) or BCR (B cell receptor) repertoire from bulk RNA-Seq data. The tool can be used for analyzing the configuration of immune receptors and the diversities of immune cells. 

Code Details and Examples:

Code: 

```bash
trust4 -f fastq_file -o output_prefix
```

The essential input for TRUST4 is a FASTQ file. The FASTQ file is a standard file format for storing readouts from sequencing experiments in bioinformatics. The input file consists of four lines for each sequence. An example of an entry from a FASTQ file can be as follows:

```text
@SEQ_ID
GATTTGGGGTTCAAAGCAGTATCGATCAAATAGTAAATCCATTTGTTCAACTCACAGTTT
+
!''*((((***+))%%%++)(%%%%).1***-+*''))**55CCF>>>>>>CCCCCCC65
```

Line 1 begins with a '@' character and is followed by a sequence identifier.
Line 2 is the raw sequence of the read.
Line 3 begins with a '+' character and is optionally followed by the same sequence identifier.
Line 4 encodes the quality values for the sequence in Line 2, using ASCII character codes to represent the numerical values.

After running the command, TRUST4 will output the following files:
- output_prefix.bam: Aligned sequences to the IMGT database.
- output_prefix.annot.fa: The details of how the assembled sequences align to the IMGT database.
- output_prefix.fq: This is the input of the annotation file.
- output_prefix.out: The main output file with CDR3 region(s) for each read.

The alignment is done based on the IMGT database so it doesn't require a reference genome.
