Use Case: BEAST (Bayesian Evolutionary Analysis Sampling Trees) is a cross-platform program for Bayesian analysis of molecular sequences using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). It is used predominantly for analyses of phylogeny and evolution.

Code Details and Examples:

Code:

An example of an input file for BEAST would be an XML file consisting of the following:

```
<beast version="1.10.4" namespace="beast.evolution.alignment:beast.evolution.sitemodel:beast.evolution.substitutionmodel:beast.evolution.tree.coalescent:beast.core:beast.math">
  <run id="mcmc" spec="beast.core.MCMC" chainLength="1000000">
    <!-- ... other specifications ... -->
  </run> 
</beast>
```
This XML file might specify things like the model of nucleotide substitution, the site model, and the tree prior.

Input file specifications: 

BEAST generally takes an XML file as input, the XML file describes the model to be run. 

File extension is .xml.

Command to run it:

When BEAST is installed in your system, you can use the command via terminal with:

```
beast filename.xml
```

Where filename.xml is the BEAST XML file you want to run.
