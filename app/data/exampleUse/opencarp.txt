Use Case: OpenCarp is a powerful simulation software package for electrocardiographic (ECG) simulations. The main application is prediction of ECG signals from patient specific heart models.

Code details and examples:

**Code:**

To run opencarp we need a settings file (typically a .cfg file) and an anatomy file representing the heart geometry (typically .vtk files). These files are highly specific to the application and are usually created by experts based on medical imagery.

*ECG simulation:*

sample cfg for a ventricle activation sequence:
  
    [stimulus]
    start = 0
    duration = 1
    strength = 50

    [grid]
    name = ventricle
    dx = 0.1 
    dy = 0.2
    dz = 0.2

    [tissue]
    class = eikonal
    velocity = 1

    [solver]
    diffusion_tensor = uniform
    use_steady_state = yes

    [output]
    output_prefix = ventricle

    [monodomain]
    solve_ground_problem = no

To run the simulation you might use command: 

`./openCarp ventricle_stim.cfg`

Please note, You will need a suitable dataset to run this command. The dataset required would include specification of heart geometry in vtk file format along side the cfg file containing the simulation parameters.
