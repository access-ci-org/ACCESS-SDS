Use Case: Quadratic programming is often used in optimization problems where there is a quadratic objective function and linear constraints. It is used to find the minimum or maximum point of a parabola. Relevant applications include machine learning, where it is used in support vector machines.

Code details and examples: Code

```r
# This example comes from IBM ILOG AMPL
library(quadprog)

# Quadratic programming parameters
Dmat <- matrix(c(1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.4), nrow=2)
dvec <- c(-2.0, -3.0)
Amat <- matrix(c(-4.0, -3.0, 0.0, 1.0, -2.0, 1.0, 1.0, -3.0, -4.0, 0.0), ncol=2)
bvec <- c(-3.0, 75.0, 10.0, 6.0, -6.0)

# Use quadprog
result <- solve.QP(Dmat, dvec, t(Amat), bvec)

# Results
print(result$solution)
```

Command to run it:

This is an R script and can be run in RStudio or any other R editor. Simply copy and paste the code and run it as a script.
