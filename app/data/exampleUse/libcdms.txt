Use Case: Libcdms is used to access and manage scientific data and is used for a wide range of applications in climate modeling. It is particularly suited to manage and manipulate netCDF data.

Code details and examples:

Code:

```python
import cdms2 as cdms
f=cdms.open('sample.nc')
s=f('variable_name') # replace variable_name with the actual variable name in the sample.nc file
print(s)
f.close()
```
This Python snippet will load the 'libcdms' module, open a netCDF file named sample.nc, read a variable named 'variable_name' from this file, print its contents, then close the file.

Sample input files:

In this example, sample.nc is a netCDF file, which is a binary file format that contains a variety of scientific data. The variable 'variable_name' is a placeholder; the actual name of the variable to be read should be substituted in.

Format required:

netCDF is the file format required. The format is binary, that is specifically designed for the storage of scientific data.

Any specifications and details in input files:

The file must have a '.nc' extension and be formatted according to the netCDF specification. One or more 'dimension' definitions must be specified, and 'variable' definitions may refer to these. 'Variable_name' must refer to a valid variable in the netCDF file.

Command to run:

In a Python environment where libcdms is installed, the command to run the above script would simply be:

```python
python script_name.py # replace script_name.py with the name of your python script file
```
