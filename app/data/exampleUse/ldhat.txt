Use Case: Use LDhat to analyse recombination rates in nucleotide sequences.

Code details and examples: Code

LDhat mainly has multiple components, but most use cases involve two critical parts: pairwise and interval.

1. Pairwise:
This program extrapolates rates of recombination between adjacent pairs of sites.

Sample Input File: infile (Nucleotide sequence file in FASTA format)

Sequence Format: 
````
>seq1
ACGCGTGAC
>seq2
ACGTGTGAC
````
Command to run it: 
````
pairwise -seq [input sequence file] -loc [file containing positions of sites] -lk [lookup table] -its [number of iterations] -burn [number of burn-in iterations]
````

2. Interval:
This program follows up on Pairwise, using a Bayesian MCMC method to fit variable recombination rates across a sequence. 

Sample Input File: same as Pairwise, but compatibility matrix is required, generated from `complete` part of LDhat.

Command to run it: 
````
interval -seq [input sequence file] -loc [file containing positions of sites] -lk [lookup table] -its [number of iterations] -burn [number of burn-in iterations] -samp [sampling frequency]
````

In both cases, the lookup table (`-lk` option) must be precomputed and is sequence length-dependent. It gets calculated with the `complete` module of LDhat. The number of iterations (`-its` option) and burn-in iterations (`-burn` option) must be chosen based on the complexity of your sequence data.
