Use Case: Use Groff (GNU roff) to format and typeset text.

Code details and examples: Code

Input files for groff are typically plain text files that include "roff" commands, which are lines that begin with a period (.). For example:

    .TH SAMPLE 1
    .SH NAME
    .PP
    Sample \- a sample man page
    .SH SYNOPSIS
    .PP
    This is a sample man page. 
    .SH DESCRIPTION
    .PP
    The descriptions should be here.

To use groff, you should save your file with a ".groff" or ".man" extension. For example, you might save the above contents in a file named "sample.man". You can then use the groff command to process the file. For example:

    $ groff -man -Tascii sample.man > sample.txt

In this example, the "-man" option specifies the format, the "-Tascii" option specifies the output format, and "> sample.txt" redirects the output to a text file. If you don't include "> sample.txt", then the output will be printed to the terminal.
  
In the file 'sample.man', '.TH' is a macro that marks a title header, '.SH' is a section header, '.PP' begins a new paragraph, and '\' commands are escape sequences. For example, '\-' inserts a hyphen.
