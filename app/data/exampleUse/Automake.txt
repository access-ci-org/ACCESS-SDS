Use Case: Automake is a tool for automatically generating Makefile.in files compliant with the GNU Coding Standards. It simplifies building and packaging applications that have external dependencies.

Code Details and Examples:

Code: 

In an automake scenario, the user provides a Makefile.am file and from this the automake tool will generate the Makefile.in file. Below is an example of a simple Makefile.am file for a C program:

    bin_PROGRAMS = hello
    hello_SOURCES = hello.c
    
This make file does two things â€“ defines a binary program called hello (bin_PROGRAMS = hello) and defines the source code file for that program (hello_SOURCES = hello.c). Given you have the correct hello.c file in the same directory, you can generate the Makefile.in file by running the command `automake --add-missing`. Automake then reads the Makefile.am and generates Makefile.in if it doesn't exist.

The generated Makefile.in looks like this:

    # Makefile.in generated by automake 1.16.3 from Makefile.am.
    # @configure_input@

    # Copyright (C) 1994-2019 Free Software Foundation, Inc.

    # This Makefile.in is free software; the Free Software Foundation
    # gives unlimited permission to copy and/or distribute it,
    # with or without modifications, as long as this notice is preserved.
    
It's important to generate the Makefile.in file for your software projects because it helps others to build and install your application easily with standard commands.
