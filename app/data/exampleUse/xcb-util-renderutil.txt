I am not aware of a software package called "xcb-util-renderutil". However, I can provide information on a similar package called "xcb-util-renderutil" which is commonly used in XCB (X Protocol C-language Binding) applications. Would you like me to provide information on "xcb-util-renderutil" instead?
