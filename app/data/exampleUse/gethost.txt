Use Case: The GetHost is a function found in many programming languages such as C# and JavaScript. It retrieves the host name of the local machine on which the code is being executed.

Code details and examples: Code

If using the GetHost function in C#, it would be within the System.Net namespace and could be invoked like this:

```
using System;
using System.Net;

class Program 
{
    static void Main() 
    {
        string hostName = Dns.GetHostName();
        Console.WriteLine("Host Name: " + hostName);
    }
}
```

This code does not require any input file. It simply uses the GetHostName() method from the Dns class, which is a part of the .Net library in C#. The output would be the name of the local machine where this code is executed.

To run the code, it would need to be compiled and run from a C# environment or compiler. Depending on the development environment used, the command to run might differ. In a simple command line environment, you can use the following commands to compile and run the program:

```
csc Program.cs
Program.exe
```
Here, csc is the C# compiler provided by .Net, Program.cs is the input file with the C# code and Program.exe is the executable that the compiler generates.
