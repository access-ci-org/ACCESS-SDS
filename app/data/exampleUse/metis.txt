Use Case: METIS is used for partitioning unstructured graphs, partitioning meshes, and computing fill-reducing orderings of sparse matrices. 

Code Details and Examples: 

The input file format for METIS is as follows. Asset idxStuff value:

```
<numVertices> <numEdges> <formattingOptions>
<vertexData>
...
<vertexData>
```
A sample input file could look like this:

```
5 7 001 
1 2 10 
2 3 30 
3 4 50 
4 5 70 
5 2 90 
2 4 120 
3 5 150 
```

Here the number of vertices is 5 and the number of edges is 7. Each subsequent line to the first has three numbers, the source vertex, destination vertex, and a weight for the edge between them. 

The command for partitioning this graph using METIS would be:

```
gpmetis file.graph nparts
```

Where nparts is the number of partitions desired. For example:

```
gpmetis sample.graph 2
```

The command line parameters for METIS can be found in the manual. For gpmetis, the full syntax is:


gpmetis [options] <GraphFile> <Nparts>
