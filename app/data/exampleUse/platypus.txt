Use Case: Platypus is a tool for variant detection in high-throughput sequencing datasets. It aims to provide an easy-to-use, fast and sensitive variant caller. It can be used to discover and genotype germline or somatic variants. 

Code details and examples: The input file for Platypus is in BAM format, which is a binary version of Sequence Alignment/Map (SAM) format. The input file contains read information i.e., where and how individual reads map to the reference genome. 

Here is an example of using Platypus to call variants:

Code:

```bash
python Platypus.py callVariants --bamFiles=input.bam --refFile=reference.fasta --output=variants.vcf
```

In the above command:

- `input.bam` is the name of your BAM file which contains aligned DNA sequences.
- `reference.fasta` is the name of your reference genome that your DNA sequences were aligned against. 
- `variants.vcf` is the output where Platypus will write the called variants in VCF format.

Here, the input file should be indexed in BAI format. `.bai` file for the given input BAM file should be in the same directory for sequential processing.

This tool does not provide code snippets or any special specifications. It simply reads from a BAM file and produces a VCF file.
