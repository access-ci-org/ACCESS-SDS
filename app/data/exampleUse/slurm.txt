Use Case: Slurm is a highly configurable open-source workload manager. It is used to manage resources on a clustered computer system. It provides three key functions: allocating exclusive and/or non-exclusive access to resources (compute nodes) to users for some duration of time, providing a framework for starting, executing, and monitoring work (normally a parallel job) on the set of allocated nodes, and arbitrating contention for resources by managing a queue of pending work.

Code Details and Examples:
To submit a batch job using slurm, you would first write a script file. Below is an example of a slurm script file:

```
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH --job-name=test_job
#SBATCH --output=res.txt
#SBATCH --time=10:00
#SBATCH --mem-per-cpu=100
#SBATCH --ntasks=1
#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=1
#SBATCH --partition=cf

srun python my_script.py
```
In the above script:

- `--job-name` sets the name of the slurm job.
- `--output` sets the name of the file where the standard output and standard error from the job will be saved.
- `--time` sets the maximum time that the job can run for. In this case, the job will be killed after 10 minutes.
- `--mem-per-cpu` sets the maximum amount of memory that each CPU can use. In this case, each CPU can use up to 100MB of memory.
- `--ntasks` sets the number of tasks that will be run for this job. In this case, only one task will be run.
- `--cpus-per-task` sets the number of CPUs that will be used for each task. In this case, each task will use one CPU.
- `--partition` sets the partition that the job will be run on. In this case, the job will be run on the cf partition.

To submit the above script as a batch job, you would use the `sbatch` command:

```shell
sbatch my_script.sh
```

Where 'my_script.sh' is the name of the slurm script file. This will submit the job to the slurm scheduler.
