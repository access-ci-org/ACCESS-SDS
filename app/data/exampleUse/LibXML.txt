Use Case: Use LibXML for parsing XML and HTML documents; typically used in web scraping or API calling scenarios where HTML or XML data is being returned. 

Code details and examples: Code for simple XML file parsing. 

Sample XML input file (file.xml):

```xml
<root>
  <element1>Text1</element1>
  <element2>Text2</element2>
  <element3>Text3</element3>
</root>
```

Python code snippet using the "libxml2" python library:

```python
import libxml2

# Parse the XML file
doc = libxml2.parseFile('file.xml')

# Get the root element
root = doc.children

# Iterate over child elements
for child in root.children:
    if child.type == 'element':
        print('Element name:', child.name)
        print('Element content:', child.content)

# Clean up
doc.freeDoc()
```

Command to run the python script (terminal command): 
```bash
python3 script.py
```

In this Python code snippet, the XML file "file.xml" is parsed, the root element is acquired, and then each child element of the root is iterated through. If the child is an "element" type, its name and content are printed out. 
The input file is required to be well-formed XML, and at a minimum must have a root element. Other details (such as element names, contents, and structure) will depend on the specifics of the analysis.

Note: for parsing HTML you can use htmlDoc = libxml2.htmlParseFile(filename, None) instead of parseFile.
