Use Case: GraphBLAS library is used for graph algorithms in the language of linear algebra. It is often used for high performance graph computations.

Code details and examples:

Before you can use GraphBLAS, you need to include the relevant headers in your C/C++ code:

```C
#include <GraphBLAS.h>
```

For instance, to create an empty GraphBLAS matrix:

```C
GrB_Matrix A;
GrB_Matrix_new(&A, GrB_INT32, 4, 4);
```

This will create a new 4x4 matrix with zero value in each cell.

To set the value of a cell:

```C
GrB_Matrix_setElement_INT32(A, 3, 0, 0); 
```

This will set the value of the cell at 0th row and 0th column to 3.

To compute the complement of A:

```C
GrB_Matrix_not(B, A);
```

This will assign to B the complement of A.

Sample input file format in Matrix Market format:

```
%%MatrixMarket matrix coordinate real general
%  
4 4 16
1 1 1.0
1 2 2.0
1 3 3.0
1 4 4.0
2 1 5.0
2 2 6.0
2 3 7.0
2 4 8.0
3 1 9.0
3 2 10.0
3 3 11.0
3 4 12.0
4 1 13.0
4 2 14.0
4 3 15.0
4 4 16.0
```

Command to compile and run this on a UNIX-style system:

```Sh
gcc -o sample source.c -lgraphblas
./sample < input_matrix.mtx
``` 

This will compile the C source code file and run it with the provided matrix market file. When linking the GraphBLAS library `-lgraphblas` is used.
