Use Case: Pyomo is often used for formulating and analyzing mathematical models for optimization. It's particularly useful for defining symbolic problems, solving them with efficient solvers, and analyzing the results.

Pyomo provides a number of ways to define a model, but one easy way is through concrete models. Here's an example for a simple linear programming problem:

```python
from pyomo.environ import *

# Create a simple model
model = ConcreteModel()

# Define the variables with lower and upper bounds
model.x = Var(within=NonNegativeReals)
model.y = Var(within=NonNegativeReals)

# Define the objective function (which we're minimizing in this case)
model.obj = Objective(expr = 2*model.x + 3*model.y, sense=minimize)

# Define the constraints
model.Constraint1 = Constraint(expr = 3*model.x + 4*model.y >= 1)
model.Constraint2 = Constraint(expr = 2*model.x + 5*model.y >= 2)
```

The input for this code is embedded in the lines defining variables, objective, and constraints. Some quantities such as variable bounds, the objective function, and constraints equations are hard-coded in this case.

The required format in this case would simply be Python code, with Pyomo-specific function calls to define the model, variables, objective, and constraints. 

After defining the model in the way shown above, it can be solved using a solver (like the open-source GLPK solver) and solutions can be displayed, for example:

```python
# Solve model using GLPK solver
solver = SolverFactory('glpk')
solver.solve(model)

# Display solutions
print("\nSolution:")
model.x.display()
model.y.display()
```

Here, the `SolverFactory` function takes the string identifier of a solver (in this case, 'glpk') and creates a solver object to use on the model. The solutions can be displayed using the `display()` function on the variables.
