Use Case: Pioman is an open-source Python library to handle asynchronous I/Os in a multiprocess or multithread environment.

Code details and examples:

Code:

```python
import pioman

# Define an event handler
def my_handler(event):
    print(event)

# Instantiate the event manager
manager = pioman.EventManager()

# Subscribe to events
manager.subscribe('my_event', my_handler)

# Emit an event
manager.emit('my_event', 'Hello, world!')

# Run the event manager loop
manager.loop()
```

This code subscribes to an event named 'my_event', and defines a handler for that event. The event handler simply prints whatever data is associated with the event. When the event is emitted, the handler is invoked.

There are no specific input files required for this code. However, the data passed when emitting the event can be of any type.

The command to run the code:

```bash
python3 my_script.py
```

Please replace "my_script.py" with the Python script file name. You also need to make sure the Pioman library is installed in the Python environment where the script is run.
