Use Case: MUSCLE (Multiple Sequence Comparison by Log-Expectation) is a software tool employed for multiple sequence alignments (MSAs). This software efficiently produces accurate alignments of protein sequences; however, it can also aligned nucleotide sequences. 

Code details and examples:

Code: 

For MUSCLE, input files are typically in FASTA format. 

An example of a FASTA file is:

```
>Sequence_1
ATGGCCGTGTACGTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGGATT
>Sequence_2
ATGGCTGCTGAAGTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGGATT
>Sequence_3
ATGGATCGTGTACGTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGGATT
```
This file contains three sequences each with a header (starts with '>'). The headers are 'Sequence_1', 'Sequence_2' and 'Sequence_3'.
  
To run MUSCLE with this input file, you would use the following command:

```
muscle -in input.fasta -out output.fasta
```
This is the basic way to run a MUSCLE alignment. 'input.fasta' is your input file, 'output.fasta' is the file that will be created by MUSCLE to store your alignment.
  
There are various other options available in MUSCLE for fine tuning the alignment process. To find more about these options, you can use the command:

```
muscle -help
