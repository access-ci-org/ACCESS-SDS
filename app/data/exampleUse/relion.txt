Use Case: Relion (for REgularised LIkelihood OptimisatioN) is used for refinement of 3D reconstructions or 2D class averages in cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM).

Code details and examples: Sample input file formats can be *.mrcs, *.star, among others. The main input is often the micrographs (raw images) themselves, particle coordinates, and sometimes an initial model. 

Code:

Consider the input files are:
1. Particles.star : A STAR file that contains the information about the particles
2. InitialModel.mrc : An MRC file used as the initial model

In the command line,
```
relion_refine --o Refine3D/run1 --auto_refine --split_random_halves --i Particles.star --ref InitialModel.mrc --ini_high 60
```
- `--o`: The name of the directory where the output files will be saved.
- `--auto_refine`: Perform automated refinement, including generation of the resolution and FSC calculation.
- `--split_random_halves`: Split the data randomly in two half-datasets. 
-  `--i`: Name of the STAR file that contains your particle images.
-  `--ref`: The name of reference map
- `--ini_high`: This flag is used to downsample the images. The number passed is the resolution in angstroms that you expect your final structure to have.

In addition, preparation of input files is crucial in cryo-EM processing, and therefore might need pre-processing stages. Please refer to Relion's official tutorial for more information: https://relion.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Manuals/user_manual.html
