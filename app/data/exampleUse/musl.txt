Use Case: Use musl for building a static "Hello, World!" program.

Code details and examples:

Code:
```c
// This is a simple Hello World program in C.
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    printf("Hello, World!");
    return 0;
}
```
Save the code in a file called `hello.c`.

The input file for musl compiler is the C source file. The format required is a standard C source code file (.c extension).

Additional specifications and details for the input file are not applicable for this use case as it is a very simple program.

To compile the code using Musl as the C library, here is a sample command:

```bash
$ musl-gcc -static -o hello hello.c
```
The `-static` flag is used for static linking, `-o hello` is used to specify the output file name, and `hello.c` is the input C source file. 

To run the compiled program:

```bash
$ ./hello
```
This will output: "Hello, World!"
