Use Case: DIAMOND is a high-performance sequence aligner for protein and translated DNA searches, designed for high-throughput sequencing data. It performs sequence alignment tasks such as BLASTX, BLASTP and RAPSearch.

Code details and examples: 

Code:

A typical usage of DIAMOND to align against a protein database would look approximately like this:

```
diamond blastx -d nr.dmnd -q reads.fna -o matches.m8
```

In this case, `nr.dmnd` is the protein database you're aligning against, `reads.fna` is your FASTA file containing the sequences you're aligning, and `matches.m8` is the file where DIAMOND will output the match results.

The required input file format for DIAMOND is FASTA or FASTQ for the query sequences, and a DIAMOND database file for alignment.

A SAM (Sequence Alignment/Map) file is created with the `-f sam` option.

A simple FASTA file could look approximately like this:

```
>sequence1
AGTCTAGTCTAGCGTACGTAGCT
>sequence2
CGTACGTACGATCGTACG
```

To create a DIAMOND database from a FASTA file:

```
diamond makedb --in reference_proteins.fasta -d reference_proteins
```

This creates a DIAMOND database named `reference_proteins.dmnd` from the input FASTA file `reference_proteins.fasta`. The `-d` option specifies the basename of the output file.
