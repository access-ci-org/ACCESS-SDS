I'm assuming you are referring to the software package "Coverage.py" used for measuring code coverage in Python programs. 

Use Case: Code coverage measurement in Python programs
Code details and examples:
Input file: Python source code files (.py)
Format required: Python script with test cases
Code snippet:
```python
# test_sample.py
def add(x, y):
    return x + y

def subtract(x, y):
    return x - y

def test_add():
    assert add(1, 2) == 3

def test_subtract():
    assert subtract(4, 2) == 2
```

Command to run the coverage measurement:
```
coverage run test_sample.py
coverage report -m
```
