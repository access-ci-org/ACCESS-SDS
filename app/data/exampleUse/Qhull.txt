Use Case: Qhull is used for computing the convex hull, Delaunay triangulation, Voronoi diagram, halfspace intersection about a point, furthest-site Delaunay triangulation, and furthest-site Voronoi diagram, among others. It is widely used in scientific and engineering fields.

Code details and examples:

Code:
Lets take a scenario where we have set of 2D points and we want to compute the Convex Hull for these points using Qhull,

Format Required: Input should be in a text file, where the first line contains the dimension (2 for 2D, 3 for 3D), the second one the number of points, and each subsequent line the coordinates of a point.

Sample Input File: 

```
2
5
1.0 1.0
2.0 5.0
3.0 3.0
5.0 2.0
5.0 5.0
```

Commands to run:

To compute Convex Hull using Qhull, the command is:

```
qhull i < input.txt
```

This will output the indices of the points forming the convex hull.
