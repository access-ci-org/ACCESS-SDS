Use Case: Gubbins (Genealogies Unbiased By recomBinations In Nucleotide Sequences)is a bioinformatics software frequently used to detect recombination in bacterial genomes and improve phylogenetic reconstructions. The input to Gubbins is a multi-FASTA format file which contains aligned whole genome sequences (WGS).

Code details and examples:
   
Code:

To run Gubbins, you command it in the following way:

```bash
run_gubbins.py --prefix output_name input_file.fasta
```

Here, 'input_file.fasta' is a FASTA file containing aligned sequences. For example:

FA0001.1
ATGGCCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCGTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGC

FA0002.1
ATGCCCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCGTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGC

And 'output_name' is a custom prefix that you designate for your output files.

Gubbins will output a number of files, including a Newick format phylogenetic tree with a structure that reflects the impact of recombination on the evolutionary history of the input genomes.
