Use Case: Asynchronous HTTP operations in Python; ideal for building high-concurrency web servers and other I/O-bound programs.

Code details and examples:

Code:

```python
from aiohttp import web

async def hello(request):
    return web.Response(text="Hello, world")

app = web.Application()
app.router.add_get('/', hello)
web.run_app(app)
```

To run this script, save it as a Python file (e.g., `server.py`) and run it using the `python` command in the command line:

```
python server.py
```

This script sets up a simple web server that responds to HTTP GET requests at the root URL (`/`) with the message "Hello, world". The response is produced by the `hello` function, which uses the `aiohttp.web.Response` class to construct a HTTP response. The `hello` function is a coroutine because it is defined with `async def`, allowing it to perform asynchronous I/O operations.

The `aiohttp.web.Application` class represents a web application. The application's router is used to set up URL routes, with the `add_get` method specifying that the `hello` function should handle GET requests at the root URL. Finally, the `web.run_app` function starts the web server.
