Use Case: Use for GPU rendering, game development and simulations development 

Code details and Examples: Code

For Vulkan SDK, you will need Vulkan SDK and a supported development environment. This will demonstrate how to set up a simple scene where a textured quad is rendered:

Sample Input:

Below is the format you would use to create a renderpass in vulkan:

```
VkRenderPassCreateInfo renderPassInfo {};
renderPassInfo.sType = VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_RENDER_PASS_CREATE_INFO;
renderPassInfo.attachmentCount = static_cast<uint32_t>(attachments.size());
renderPassInfo.pAttachments = attachments.data();
renderPassInfo.subpassCount = 1;
renderPassInfo.pSubpasses = &subpass;
renderPassInfo.dependencyCount = static_cast<uint32_t>(dependencies.size());
renderPassInfo.pDependencies = dependencies.data();

if (vkCreateRenderPass(device, &renderPassInfo, nullptr, &renderPass) != VK_SUCCESS) {
    throw std::runtime_error("failed to create render pass!");
}
```

This example command shows the input format required to create a Vulkan Renderpass, you define the necessary specifications and call the vkCreateRenderPass function. The input file is essentially the C++ source code file.

Command to compile Vulkan SDK source code:

If the above code was saved in a file named "main.cpp", for concreteness, you could use the following commands to build and run your program:

````
g++ main.cpp -o vulkanApp `pkg-config --static --libs glfw3` -lvulkan
````
Then, you can run the application with:
````
./vulkanApp
````
The compilation and running might vary based on the development environment used. This example considers gcc for a linux based development environment and GLFW for window and input handling. You might also need to include proper header files.
