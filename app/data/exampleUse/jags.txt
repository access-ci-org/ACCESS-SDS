Use Case: JAGS (Just Another Gibbs Sampler) is a software package for analysis of Bayesian hierarchical models using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation. JAGS is commonly used by statisticians and data analysts for complex data modeling.

Code Details and Examples: 

Input File Format: The input data for JAGS should be in RDATA format, which is a binary file format for storing data in an R workspace. The input file can contain all the data vectors and matrices required for the analysis.

Input File Specifications: The input file should define all variables and parameters required for the model. 

Sample Input File: 

Let's assume we have an RDATA file named "data.RData" with variables x and y defined. 

```r
# In R:
x <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
y <- c(2, 4, 6, 8, 10)
save(x, y, file = "data.RData")
```

JAGS model file ("model.bug") might look like this:

```jags
model {
  for (i in 1:N) {
    y[i] ~ dnorm(mu[i], tau)
    mu[i] <- a + b * x[i]
  }
  a ~ dnorm(0, .0001)
  b ~ dnorm(0, .0001)
  tau <- pow(sigma, -2) 
  sigma ~ dunif(0, 100)  
}
```

Code Snippet:

Using JAGS from within R through rjags library might look like this:

```r
# In R:
library(rjags)
load("data.RData")
jags.data <- list("x" = x, "y" = y, "N" = length(y))
parameters <- c("a", "b", "sigma")
model <- jags.model("model.bug", data = jags.data)
update(model, 1000) # Burn-in
samples <- coda.samples(model, variable.names = parameters, n.iter = 1000, by = 1)
```

Command to run:

This will run the defined JAGS model for 1000 iterations, after a burn-in of 1000 iterations. The R script can be executed in an R environment with the command `source("script.R")`, where "script.R" is the filename of the R script.
