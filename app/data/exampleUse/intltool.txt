Use Case: intltool is used to extract translatable strings from source files. This helps to internationalize different parts of a program into numerous languages. It's commonly used in software development where the application needs to support multiple languages.

Code details and examples:

If we take an example of a .po file like:

```
msgid ""
msgstr " "
"Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8\n"

msgid "Hello World!"
msgstr "Hola Mundo!"
```
This would be a simple translation file for a program that prints "Hello World!" and we want it to support Spanish, translating "Hello World!" to "Hola Mundo!"

To export translations to .mo files (which is the format gettext uses), you would use:

Code:

```shell
msgfmt es.po -o es.mo
```

This would generate an `es.mo` file which can be used to translate the original program strings to Spanish.

For extracting translatable strings from source files to create a .pot file, the command would be:

Code:

```shell
intltool-extract --type=gettext/ini filename.extension
```

This will generate a .pot file that is used to translate the original source strings.

Here, filename.extension is the name and extension of the source file one wants to extract the strings from.
