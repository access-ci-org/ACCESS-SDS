Use Case: Use CuPy for matrix computation or n-dimensional array; CuPy is good for numerical computations using GPU. 

Code details and examples: Code.

```python
import cupy as cp

x_gpu = cp.array([1, 2, 3])
y_gpu = cp.array([4, 5, 6])
z_gpu = x_gpu * y_gpu

print(z_gpu)
```

The input file is not applicable here, as the values are directly provided in the code.

Sample Output: array([ 4, 10, 18])

Once the code is written, you can run it from the terminal or any Python environment with the command:

```bash
python filename.py
```
Make sure your Python environment has CuPy installed and if you're running from the terminal, replace `filename` with the actual Python file name. 

Specifications and Details in input files: N/A for this case as we are directly inputting the arrays in the code.

There is no specific format required for this case as input is not taken from a file but given directly in the code.
