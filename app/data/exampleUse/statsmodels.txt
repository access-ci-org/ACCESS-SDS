Use Case: Use statsmodels for linear regression problem and prediction.

Code Details and Examples: Code 

1. Required python libraries: pandas, numpy, statsmodels.api
2. Input data: The input file is a CSV file with numeric data for the independent and dependent variables.

```
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import statsmodels.api as sm

df = pd.read_csv('input.csv')

X = df['independent_var']
Y = df['dependent_var']

# Add a constant to the independent value
X = sm.add_constant(X)

# Carry out the linear regression
model = sm.OLS(Y, X)

# Fit the model
results = model.fit()

# Use the model to make predictions
predictions = results.predict(X)

# Save predictions to csv
predictions.to_csv('predictions.csv')
```

Command to run: This python script can be run from the command line with the command python3 script_name.py, replacing 'script_name.py' with the name of your file.
  
This code reads in the 'input.csv' file with pandas. It then assigns the 'independent_var' and 'dependent_var' columns to X and Y respectively. The statsmodels.api.OLS method is used to perform the linear regression, and the model is then used to make predictions on the input data. These predictions are then written to a new CSV file called 'predictions.csv'. For the purpose of this code snippet, it's assumed that the 'input.csv' file has numeric data for 'independent_var' and 'dependent_var' columns.
