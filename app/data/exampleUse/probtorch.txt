Use Case: ProbTorch is a PyTorch-based Scriptable Probabilistic Programming (SPP) library. It allows us to build probabilistic models using PyTorch's tensor library.

Code Details and Examples:

Code: 

```python
import torch
from probtorch import probtorch

# Initialize PyTorch and ProbTorch
pytorch_seed = 1
probtorch_seed = 2
torch.manual_seed(pytorch_seed)
probtorch.manual_seed(probtorch_seed)

# Define a simple probabilistic model
def model():
    weight = probtorch.Parameter(torch.tensor(0.5))  
    heads = probtorch.bernoulli(weight)  
    return heads
print(model())  # Outputs: 1 (with 50% probability) or 0 (with 50% probability)

# Define a simple guide (approximate posterior)
def guide():
    weight_q = probtorch.Parameter(torch.tensor(0.8))  
    heads_q = probtorch.bernoulli(weight_q)
    return heads_q

# Get an enumeration of samples from the guide
num_samples = 1000
for s in guide().enumerate_support():
    print(s)
```

This model and guide define a simple Bernoulli random variable (a coin flip) with a probability of being Heads. The model has a 50% chance of being Heads, while the guide has an 80% chance of being Heads. The guide is used for variational inference, and it is supposed to be a good approximation of the model's posterior distribution. In this case, the guide is a poor approximation because it overestimates the probability of Heads. The `.enumerate_support()` function generates a list of all possible outcomes of a discrete random variable, which are 0 (Tails) and 1 (Heads) for a Bernoulli random variable.

Command to run:

```bash
$ python probtorch_example.py
