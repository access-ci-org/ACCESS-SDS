Use Case: Elemental is a distributed-memory dense and sparse-direct linear algebra and optimization library, and it can be used for various purposes such as solving linear systems, factorizing matrices, and computing eigenvalues and singular values, etc.

Code details and examples: 

Input:

You would typically pass a .m file containing the matrix and the command line option to run the software would be similar to:

```terminal
mpiexec -n 2 ./tests/HermitianGenDefEig
```

It important to set the MPI -n option to the number of cores on your machine for parallel computation and replace ./tests/HermitianGenDefEig with the correct path of your test file.

Code:
```Python
#!/usr/bin/env python
import El
n0 = 100
n1 = 100

# Start Elmer
El.Initialize()

# Construct a 2D process grid from the number of processes
grid = El.Grid(El.mpi.COMM_WORLD)
n = n0*n1
A = El.DistMatrix(grid)
El.HermitianUniformSpectrum(A,n,1,10)
lambdas = El.DistMatrix(El.mpi.COMM_WORLD)
El.HermitianGenDefEig(El.AXBX,El.ADJ,El.UPPER,A,A,lambdas)
El.Zeros(A,n,1)
El.Multiply(El.NORMAL,El.NORMAL,1,lambdas,A,A)

El.Finalize()
```

By running the command on the command line, it will perform a hermitian generalized definite eigenproblem on a distributed memory and store the result in A.
