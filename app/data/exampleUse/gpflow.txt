Use Case: GPflow is typically used for building complex Gaussian process models in Python using TensorFlow, particularly for machine learning or statistical modeling applications.

Code details and examples:
Code:

```python
import gpflow
import numpy as np

# Sample input data
X = np.random.randn(10, 1)
Y = np.sin(X) + np.random.randn(*X.shape) * 0.05

# Define the kernel
k = gpflow.kernels.Matern52()

# Define the model
m = gpflow.models.GPR(data=(X, Y), kernel=k, mean_function=None)

# Fit the model
opt = gpflow.optimizers.Scipy()
opt.minimize(m.training_loss, m.trainable_variables)

# Predict
mean, var = m.predict_y(X)
```

Input Files format:
GPflow does not require a specific input file format, instead, input data is typically given as numpy arrays in Python. In the above example, `X` is a 10x1 numpy array of random floats, and `Y` is a 10x1 numpy array which is the sine of `X` plus some Gaussian noise.

Specifications and details in input files:
There is no "input file" per se in this context, as the datapoints are directly fed into the model through Python commands. What's needed is the `X` and `Y` numpy arrays which represent the inputs and targets respectively.

Command to run: 
This code would typically be run in a Python interpreter or a jupyter notebook.
