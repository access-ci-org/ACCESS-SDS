Use Case: Bioawk is an extension to Brian Kernighan's awk, which adds support for several common biological data formats used in bioinformatics. An example use case could be getting a count of the number of sequences in a FASTA file.

Code details and examples: Code

Bioawk requires inputs files to be in a format like FASTA, fastq, sam, BED, GFLASH, vcf etc. A common use might be to count sequences in a FASTA file, the standard format for DNA sequences.

For that, the fasta file content could be like:

```
>seq0
ATGGCGTAGCAGTAGCTAGTCTCAGTACGTA
>seq1
ACGTACGTACGTACGTAGCTAGCATGCTAGC
>seq2
ACGTTTACGTACGTAGC
```

The FASTA format starts with a single-line description, followed by lines of sequence data. The description line is distinguished from the sequence data by a greater-than (">") symbol at the beginning of the line. 

The first character of the FASTA sequence identifier is ">". The rest of the line is a description of the sequence. The sequence follows on as many lines as necessary.

In this case, with your simple fasta file, you can get a count of the number of sequences in the fasta file using:

```bash
bioawk -c fastx '{ print $name, $seq }' input.fasta
```

Here `$name` and `$seq` represent the name and sequence fields from the fasta file.

The result will be:

```
seq0 ATGGCGTAGCAGTAGCTAGTCTCAGTACGTA
seq1 ACGTACGTACGTACGTAGCTAGCATGCTAGC
seq2 ACGTTTACGTACGTAGC
```

Also, to get the count of sequences, you can use:

```bash
bioawk -c fastx 'END{print NR}' input.fasta
```

Result will be:

```
