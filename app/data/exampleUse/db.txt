Use Case: You are creating a database in MySQL with a table to store users' contact information.

Code details and examples: 

Code:

First, you should define the SQL command with CREATE DATABASE UsersDB; to create a new database and CREATE TABLE Contacts; to create a new table. The table will consist of columns for ID (a unique identifier), First Name, Last Name, Phone and Email.

```SQL
CREATE DATABASE UsersDB;
USE UsersDB;
CREATE TABLE Contacts (
    ID INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
    FirstName VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    LastName VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    Phone VARCHAR(15),
    Email VARCHAR(100),
    PRIMARY KEY (ID)
);
```

To insert data into the table, you would use the following example command:

```SQL
INSERT INTO Contacts (FirstName, LastName, Phone, Email)
VALUES ('John', 'Doe', '123-456-7890', 'john.doe@email.com');
```

Suppose you want to extract John Doe's information, you can use a SELECT statement:

```SQL
SELECT * FROM Contacts WHERE FirstName='John' AND LastName='Doe';
```

To execute your SQL commands, you would typically use a client such as MySQL Workbench or from command line as below

```bash
mysql -u username -p < myfile.sql
```

Here, "username" is your MySQL username, "-p" prompts for your password, and "myfile.sql" is the file containing your SQL commands.
