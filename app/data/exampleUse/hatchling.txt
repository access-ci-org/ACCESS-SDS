Use Case: Hatchling is a high-performance parallel computing software, often used for molecular dynamics simulations. It can simulate the behavior of a system of particles in a way that takes into account the interactions between all the particles in the system.

Code details and examples: Code

Input file format:
Hatchling works with two types of input files: a "system" file, that describes the system to be simulated, and a "parameter" file, which provides the parameters for the simulation.

System File:
The system file is in the PDB (Protein Data Bank) format. This format is text-based and provides information about the atoms in the system, such as their types, positions, velocities, and acceleration.

Example system file (water.pdb):

```
ATOM      1  O   HOH     1      -0.007  -0.002   0.001  0.00  0.00      WAT  OW  1
ATOM      2  H1  HOH     1      -0.757  -0.002   0.001  0.00  0.00      WAT  H   1
ATOM      3  H2  HOH     1       0.243  -0.002   0.001  0.00  0.00      WAT  H   1
END
```

Parameter File:
The parameter file uses a custom text-based format to specify the parameters of the simulation. These include, for example, the duration of the simulation, the time step size, and the temperatures.

Example parameter file (params.in):

```
# Hatchling input file

# Simulation parameters
timestep = 1.0 # in fs
duration = 10000 # in fs
temperature = 300 # in K

# System parameters
system = water.pdb
```

Command to Run:
To run a simulation with Hatchling, you launch the program from the command line, providing the system file and parameter file as arguments.

```
