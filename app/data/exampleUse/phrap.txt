Use Case: Phrap is widely used as a foundational tool in gene sequencing projects and genomic research for assembling sequence reads into longer, more contiguous sequences.

Code details and examples:

Code:

An example of an input file for running phrap would look something like this (in FASTA format):

```
>sequence1
ACTGACTGACTGACTGACTGACTG
>sequence2
CTGACTGACTGACTGACTGACTGA
```

Now you want to assembly this sequences you can run `phrap`:

Command

```shell
phrap sequence_data.fasta
```

The program will generate several output files. The file `.contigs` will contain the assembled sequences, the file `.singlets` will contain the sequences which could not be assembled. The `.view` file is a concatenation of the .ace and .contigs file. 

Please note all these commands and file names are examples and the actual file input / commands might differ based on the actual data and software version used.
