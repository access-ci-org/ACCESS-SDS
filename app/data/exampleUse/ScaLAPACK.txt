Use Case: ScaLAPACK (Scalable Linear Algebra PACKage) is a software library used for performing parallel linear algebra computations. This tool is designed for distributed memory machines and can be used to solve systems of linear equations, linear least squares problems, eigenvalue problems, and singular value problems.

Code details and examples: Code

We're using a basic example of solving a linear system of equations AX = b using ScaLAPACK. The system is defined as follows:

    A = [4, 1; 3, 2]
    b = [1; 1]

The ScaLAPACK input file "input.dat" can be written as:

    4 1 1
    3 2 1

Code Snippets for ScaLAPACK procedure "PDGESV" can be written in FORTRAN:

    INTEGER            N, NRHS, INFO
    PARAMETER          (N=2, NRHS=1)
    DOUBLE PRECISION   A(N, N), B(N, NRHS)
    INTEGER            IPIV(N)
    
    ! Initialization 
    A(1,1) = 4; 
    A(1,2) = 1;
    A(2,1) = 3;
    A(2,2) = 2;
    B(1,1) = 1;
    B(2,1) = 1;
    
    ! Call ScaLAPACK to solve
    CALL PDGESV(N, NRHS, A, 1, 1, DESC_A, IPIV, B, 1, 1, DESC_B, INFO)

    IF (INFO .NE. 0) THEN
        PRINT *, 'The linear equation could not be solved. INFO = ', INFO
        STOP
    END IF
    
    PRINT *, 'The solution is '
    PRINT *, 'X = ', B(1,1)
    PRINT *, 'Y = ', B(2,1)
    END

This code must be compiled using a FORTRAN compiler with MPI and ScaLAPACK libraries. The gfortran compiler could be used with the mpif90 wrapper:

    mpif90 -o solver example.f -L /usr/local/lib/ -lscalapack

To run the compiled code using 4 processes:

    mpirun -np 4 ./solver
