Use Case: ColabFold is used for predicting protein structures from sequences. The package utilizes deep learning models trained on vast protein structure databases to generate highly accurate protein structure predictions.

Code details and examples: Code

The input for ColabFold is a protein sequence(s) in Fasta format.

Sample Input File (fasta):

```
>Sequence1
MTEYKLVVVGAGGVGKSALTIQLIQNHFVDEYDPTIEDSYRKQVVIDGETCLLDILDTAG
QEEYSAMRDQYMRTGEGFLCVFAINNTKSFEDIHQYREQIKRVKDSDDVPMVLVGNKCDL
```

Note: The header line (begins with a >) is optional and often holds information like a unique identifier for the sequence and/or an informative description.

To run ColabFold you would typically use a command in the Google Colab environment integrated with Jupyter notebook, since ColabFold is a Google Colab notebook itself. Make sure you also have the neccessary dependencies like py3Dmol, and follow the Google Colab instructions to start the notebook and enter the protein sequence to execute the predictions. Due to the interactive nature of the ColabFold Google Colab notebook, it doesn't have a single command line instruction to execute.

For instance:

```python
# Any dependency imports
import py3Dmol

# Input sequence(s) in FASTA format
seq = """
>Sequence1
MTEYKLVVVGAGGVGKSALTIQLIQNHFVDEYDPTIEDSYRKQVVIDGETCLLDILDTAG
QEEYSAMRDQYMRTGEGFLCVFAINNTKSFEDIHQYREQIKRVKDSDDVPMVLVGNKCDL
"""

# Call the prediction function on the sequence
prediction = alphafold_model.predict(seq)

# The prediction is a dictionary containing different results from the AlphaFold model
# Here, we simply display the predicted 3D structure using py3Dmol
import py3Dmol
view = py3Dmol.view(js='3dmol.js')
view.addModel(prediction['3d_structure'],'pdb')
view.setStyle({'cartoon':{'color':'spectrum'}})
view.zoomTo()
view.show()
```

(Note: The ColabFold Google Colab requires token access which is also obtained inside the notebook following the on-screen instructions)
