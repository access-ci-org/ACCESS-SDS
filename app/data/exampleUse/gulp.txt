Use Case: GULP is employed for performing a variety of material modellings in atomic scale, including lattice dynamics, molecular dynamics, and monte carlo simulations, among others. 

Code details and examples: Code  

Input Files Format:

GULP adopts straightforward ASCII input file. Keywords are not case-sensitive, but atom labels are. The input file mainly contains three sections:

- Header: This include directive defining the type of the calculation 
- Model: This includes details about the system under study. It contain information about atoms, their coordinates, lattice parameters, etc.
- Tail: This sets further control options and contains less-used directives.

Example:

Header
```
single

Model

 0.00 4.18 0.00
 0.00 0.00 6.71

# Atoms
Si core 2 0.00 0.00 0.00 1
Si core 2 2.09 2.09 1.6775 1
O shel 1 1.6764 1.6764 1.3 2
O shel 1 2.5036 2.5036 0.3775 2
```

Tail
```
dump every 2 conp.xyz
```

Command to run: Make sure you have the input file (for example, "gulp.in"). Use the command as follow:

```
gulp < gulp.in > gulp.out
```

This command reads the input from "gulp.in" file and directs the output to the "gulp.out". You can replace these names with your respective input and output files.
