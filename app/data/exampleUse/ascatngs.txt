Use Case: Use ASCATngs for Allele-Specific Copy number Analysis of Tumors. 

Code details and examples: Code

The ASCATngs tool is used for whole genome allelic-specific copy number from next gen sequencing data, particularly from tumor samples. 

Sample Input File:
The input files needed are usually in BAM format, and you can also include SNPs positions file. 

An example of an input file could be:

```
Tumor_sample.bam
Normal_sample.bam
SNPs_position.txt
```

In the SNP_positions file, the format required is BED (Browser Extensible Data), which could look like this:

```
chromosome start end name score strand
chr1    713984  713985  SNP1    0   +
chr1    714026  714027  SNP2    0   +
chr1    714057  714058  SNP3    0   +
```

Command to Run:
The basic command to run ASCATngs would be: 

```
ASCAT.pl -o ASCAT_output -tumour Tumor_sample.bam -normal Normal_sample.bam -snp_gc SNPs_position.txt -gender XX
```

Adjust parameters as necessary according to the specifications of your files.
