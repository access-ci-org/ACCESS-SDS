Use Case: BerkeleyGW is a High Performance Computing software used for carrying out excited-state properties calculations in a wide range of materials.

Code Details and Examples:

Code: This suite includes several modules and files. For instance, a simple GW calculation uses at least four modules: epsilon, sigma, testconv, and abinitio (optional).

Input file formats:

The Sigma module uses a specific type of input file that has extension .in. An example of this file for diamond would look like:

```
BEGIN
input_wfn_file = 'wfn'
input_wfn_format = sp
nempty = 5
lattvec_constant = 10.7
ncore = 1
fout_gwfile = 'gwfile'
ngridq = 3 3 3
BEGIN
bands
 2         50       1
END
BEGIN
qpoints
0    0    0
END
tmp_dir = './tmp'
EXTRAPOLATE_FREQ
END
```

Command to run it: 
```
mpirun -np 16 sigma.cplx
```
The epsilon module also uses a specific type of input file with an extension .eps.in. 

```
BEGIN
input_wfn_file = 'wfn'
input_wfn_format = sp
nempty = 5
fgrid_specifier = 0 0 61 1
ngridk = 2 2 2
fout_bsefile = 'bsefile'
tmp_dir = '/tmp_dir/epsilon'
BEGIN
qpoints
 0    0    0
END
END
```
Command to run it:
```
mpirun -np 16 epsilon.cplx
```
Both epsilon and sigma input files require the basic format and information about the system, such as the wavefunction file, k-point, and q-point specifications. 

The testconv module uses a sigma.log file as its input. 

Command to run it:
```
testconv sigma.log
```

It will generate a gwfile that contains the output of the GW calculation. 

Please be aware that you should adjust all these parameters according to the system and the resources you have available.
