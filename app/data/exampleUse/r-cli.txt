Use Case: r-cli, a package for Python language, provides a system for creating command line interfaces. It offers a simple way to write scripts that are easy to use, easy to read, and easy to maintain. 

Code Details and Examples: 

Code Sample: 

To use r-cli, you normally write simple JSON files that describe your command's function and it reads these files to generate code. 

rcli.json:

```json
{
  "prog": "HelloWorld",
  "description": "Greet the world",
  "args": [
    "name"
  ]
}
```

This tells r-cli that you have a command named HelloWorld that takes one argument, name. When this file is read by r-cli, it will generate a function like this:

```python
def HelloWorld(name):
    print(f'Hello, {name}!')
```

You can run this program as follows:

```shell
python HelloWorld.py World
```

And it will print: 

```
Hello, World!
```

This is a very simple example and r-cli supports a lot more features, including optional arguments, argument types, sub-commands, and user-defined functions.
