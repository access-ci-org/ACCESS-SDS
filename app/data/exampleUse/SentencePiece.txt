Use Case: Use SentencePiece for subword tokenization in natural language processing tasks;

Code details and examples: Code

To utilize SentencePiece, the text data required for training must be in a plain text file. Each line of the file corresponds to a single sentence. 

```plaintext
This is a sample sentence.
SentencePiece is used for tokenization.
Train the tokenizer on this data.
```
Save the above sentences in a file named "data.txt". 

To train a SentencePiece tokenizer, use the command line interface.

```shell
spm_train --input=data.txt --model_prefix=m --vocab_size=2000
```
This will train a tokenizer on `data.txt` and save the model and vocabulary to files named `m.model` and `m.vocab` respectively. `vocab_size` indicates the number of unique tokens in the vocabulary.

After the model is trained, it can be used to encode text into subwords. 

```shell
spm_encode --model=m.model --output_format=nbest_id
```
`output_format` specifies the output format. `nbest_id` output format returns the n-best segmentations with segment ids.

For Python usage, import SentencePiece as spm and initialize SentencePieceProcessor.

```python
import sentencepiece as spm

# Load the model file
sp = spm.SentencePieceProcessor()
sp.load('m.model')

# Encode a sentence
encoded = sp.encode_as_pieces('This is a test')
print(encoded)

# Decode a list of pieces
decoded = sp.decode_pieces(encoded)
print(decoded)
```
The `encode_as_pieces` method tokenizes a sentence into subwords. The `decode_pieces` method reconstructs the original sentence from the subwords.
