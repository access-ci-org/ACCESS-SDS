Use Case: affyio is an R Bioconductor package focusing on parsing Affymetrix files. It's generally used in bioinformatics or computational biology for the preprocessing, quality assessment and analysis of microarray data.

Code Details and Examples:

The input file for Affyio would be Affymetrix cell intensity file (.CEL file).

Code:
```R
library(affyio)

# Reading the .CEL file
data <- read.celfile("file.CEL")

# Displaying the data
print(data)
```

Command to Run: You just need to replace "file.CEL" with your file name and run the script on R console. 

In case your file is located in a directory other than your current working directory, you would need to set the directory to where your CEL data file is located using function `setwd()`. You can pass the directory path as a parameter to this function before reading the CEL file. 

```R
setwd("path/to/your/directory")
```
