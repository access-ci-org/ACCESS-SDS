Use Case: Go-Bootstrap is utilized to scaffold a new Go web app project. It aids in generating a new Go HTTP service. 

Code details and examples:

Code: 

Here is a sample of Go code, which is usually stored in a *.go file.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"net/http"
)

func helloWorld(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request){
	fmt.Fprintf(w, "Hello World")
}

func main() {
	http.HandleFunc("/", helloWorld)
	http.ListenAndServe(":6111", nil)
}
```
This is a common "Hello, World!" program written in Go. It declares a main package (a package is a way to group functions), imports the http library and uses its functions and methods and starts a web server.

In the main function, two lines are running an HTTP server. The function `http.HandleFunc` is a function to call a router set up by a previous function (e.g., `http.NewServeMux()`), and tell it to send HTTP requests at the root URL ("/") to a function called `HelloWorld`. It then starts an HTTP server that listens on port 6111.

Here is a basic command to run your go script:

```bash 
go run HelloWorld.go
```

It will start an HTTP server at localhost:6111 accessible in a browser where it prints 'Hello World'.
