Use Case: Bedtools is a powerful toolset for genome arithmetic. It allows one to intersect, merge, count, complement, and shuffle genomic intervals from multiple files in widely-used genomic file formats such as BAM, BED, GFF/GTF, VCF.

Code details and examples:

Code:

Here is an example. Assume you have two BED files, `file1.bed` and `file2.bed`.

File1.bed
```
chr1    100    200
chr1    200    300
chr1    300    400
```

File2.bed
```
chr1    150   350
```

You can use the `bedtools intersect` command to find overlapping intervals in these two BED files.

The command would be:

```bash
bedtools intersect -a file1.bed -b file2.bed
```

This command would output overlapping intervals:

```bash
chr1    150    200
chr1    200    300
chr1    300    350
```

Specifications on Input Files:
- The BED files should be tab separated and should not contain header lines.
- The files should contain genomic intervals (chromosome, start, end).
- The start position is 0-based and the end position is 1-based.
- The intervals in the BED files should be sorted based on the chromosome and start position. If not sorted, you can use `bedtools sort` command to sort them.
