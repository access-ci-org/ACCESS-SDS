Use Case: Use Tkinter to create a GUI that takes user input and displays it in a label.

Code details and examples: Code.

To generate a simple GUI that collects user input and displays it, you can use the following code:

```Python
# Required Libraries
import tkinter as tk

# Function to display the input text.
def display_text():
   fetch_text = name.get()                       # Fetch the input provided by the user.
   print_label = tk.Label(window, text=fetch_text)   # Create label widget to print text.
   print_label.pack()                            # Pack the widget in the GUI.
  
window = tk.Tk()                                # Create the main window.

name = tk.StringVar()                           # Create a Tkinter variable to hold text.

# Create an Entry widget to collect input text from the user.
input_text = tk.Entry(window, textvariable=name, width = 40)

input_button = tk.Button(window, text="Print Text", command=display_text)  # Button to call function.

# Pack the widgets.
input_text.pack()
input_button.pack()

window.mainloop()                               # Call the Main GUI function.
```
This command is run directly in the python environment. 

This python script creates a window with an input field and a button. When you input text and click the 'Print Text' button, the input text is displayed in the window. This is a basic example, but you can extend and develop it to create complex GUIs. 

The input file is not needed in this case, this tutorial directly takes input from the users from the GUI. 

Note: This script is executed directly in the python environment, no additional commands are required to run it. Just save it as a .py file and execute it in a python environment.
