Use Case: The Gaussian suite is a quantum chemistry package used for performing density functional theory, molecular dynamics, quantum mechanics, and more. It is widely used in fields like material science, computational chemistry, and biochemistry.

Code details and examples: Code

The input file for Gaussian is usually a text file with the .gjf or .com extension. The structure of the input file is divided into five parts: Link0 commands, Route section, Title section, Molecular specification section, and optional additional input sections.

A simple Gaussian input file to run a Hartree-Fock calculation on water molecule would look like this:

%sample gaussian input file - water.gjf
%chk=water.chk
%nprocshared=2
%mem=1GB
#p HF/6-31G(d) opt

Water Energy

0 1
O 0.000000 -0.007156 0.965491
H 0.000000 0.001486 -0.003471
H 0.000000 0.931026 1.207929

Link0 commands start with % (e.g., %chk and %mem, which specify the checkpoint file name and the memory size to use, respectively). The # symbol begins the Route section, followed by keywords specifying the calculation type (HF), basis set (6-31G(d)), and whether to perform an optimization (“opt”).

Following this, you provide a title (e.g., "Water Energy"), molecular charge and multiplicity (0 1 for neutral water), and atomic coordinates.

The calculation can be made to run by passing the input file to Gaussian with the following shell command:

g16 < water.gjf > water.log

Running this command would start the Gaussian 16 calculation as specified in the water.gjf file and write the output to a file named water.log. Before executing, ensure you have set the correct path variables for Gaussian. Check Gaussian's instructions to do this.
