Use Case: lz4 is an extremely fast lossless compression algorithm, which provides compression speed > 500 MB/s per core. It's suited for applications such as fast backup and recovery, file and data archiving, real-time big data compression etc.

Code details and examples: Code

Input File: Any file that user wishes to compress/decompress. 

Command to run:
```
lz4 [arg] [input] [output]
```

Arguments, `[arg]`, can be one of the following:
- `-h` or `--help`: display help/usage message.
- `-d` or `--decompress`: decompress.
- `-z` or `--compress`: compress. Compression is the default behavior, so it's technically optional.

Example:

Let's say we want to compress a file named `input.txt`:

```
lz4 input.txt compressed.lz4
```

And then decompress it:

```
lz4 -d compressed.lz4 output.txt
```

Input Files specifications:
- lz4 has no specific input file specification, it can compress any type of file.

Format required: No specific format as it compresses the raw bytes.

Code snippets: N/A

Command to run them: Mentioned in the code example.
