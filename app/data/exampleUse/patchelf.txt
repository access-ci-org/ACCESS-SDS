Use Case: Patchelf is a small utility that is used to modify the dynamic linker and RPATH of ELF executables. It can be used for, say, telling an executable to look for shared libraries at a different path than originally specified.

Code details and examples: Code

Input: ELF format executables
Specification: The executable should be in ELF format.

For example, if you want to change the interpreter of an ELF executable:
```
patchelf --set-interpreter /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 ./myexecutable
```

Or if you want to change the rpath to a different location:
```
patchelf --set-rpath /my/custom/lib/ ./myexecutable
```

No specific input files are needed, you simply need an ELF binary that you want to modify. The changes are made in-place, so be careful not to lose your original binary if things go wrong.
