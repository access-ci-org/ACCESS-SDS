Use Case: Use Score-P for performance profiling to analyze the behavior of parallel applications.

Code details and Examples: Code

Sample Input Files of Score-P may include C, C++, Fortran source files, or executables with additional compiler flags.

Code Snippet:

```C++
#include <stdio.h>
#include "scorep/SCOREP_User.h"

int main() {
    SCOREP_USER_REGION_DEFINE( handle );
    SCOREP_USER_REGION_BEGIN( handle, "main", SCOREP_USER_REGION_TYPE_COMMON );

    printf("Hello, World!\n");

    SCOREP_USER_REGION_END( handle );
    return 0;
}
```

To compile your program with Score-P, we need to use Score-P wrapper for the compiler. Here is an example of how to compile above code (named as hello.c) using Score-P gcc compiler wrapper:

`scorep gcc hello.c -o hello`

To run the compiled code:

`mpiexec -n 4 ./hello`

With the Score-P wrapper, more detailed performance analysis can be performed by using tools like Vampir, Cube, etc. The wrapper usually takes care of instrumenting your code and generates event trace files (usually in .otf2 format).

The format requires the code to be in C/C++ or Fortran format. The specifications in the code are tailored towards the functioning of the performance tool, following the syntax of the wrapper and user region definition and actions.
