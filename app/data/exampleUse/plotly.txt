Use Case: Use plotly for creating interactive and visually appealing plots in Python.

Code details and examples:

Code:

```python
import plotly.graph_objects as go

# Create random data with numpy
import numpy as np
np.random.seed(1)

N = 100
random_x = np.linspace(0, 1, N)
random_y0 = np.random.randn(N) + 5
random_y1 = np.random.randn(N)
random_y2 = np.random.randn(N) - 5

# Create traces
fig = go.Figure()
fig.add_trace(go.Scatter(x=random_x, y=random_y0,
                    mode='lines',
                    name='lines'))
fig.add_trace(go.Scatter(x=random_x, y=random_y1,
                    mode='lines+markers',
                    name='lines+markers'))
fig.add_trace(go.Scatter(x=random_x, y=random_y2,
                    mode='markers', name='markers'))

fig.show()
```

Input format: An array or list of numerical data is often used as input for this software. This example takes in three sets of numpy arrays: random_x, random_y0, random_y1, and random_y2.

Command: There is no command to run this apart from running the python script itself or executing the jupyter notebook cell containing it.

The above code generates an interactive scatter plot with three different series, each represented with a different type of visualization: lines, lines + markers and markers respectively. The 'show' function at the end is used to visualise the graph.
