Use Case: r-labeling is an R package used for optimal placement of node labels on graphs.

Code details and examples: 

RLabels provides a format for adjacency matrices as input, which demonstrate the relationships between nodes in a graph. Nodes represent entities and edges represent connections between them. An adjacency matrix can be visualized successfully by using the package.

Sample adjacency matrix:

```R
# Node A connects to B, B connects to C and C connects to D
graph <- matrix(c(0, 1, 0, 0,
                  1, 0, 1, 0,
                  0, 1, 0, 1,
                  0, 0, 1, 0), nrow = 4, byrow = TRUE)
colnames(graph) <- c("A", "B", "C", "D")
rownames(graph) <- c("A", "B", "C", "D")
```

To use r-labeling to plot this graph, we execute the command:
```R
library(rlabel)
plotGraph(graph)
```

This will illustrate a diagram with suitable labels. The labels are placed optimally to minimize the overlap between labels and providing a clear visualization.
