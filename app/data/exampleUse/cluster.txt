Use Case: Clustering is a technique in data mining that groups similar items together. Suppose you have a dataset of customer buying habits and want to find patterns or segments in that data. The 'cluster' library in Python provides a set of functions for conducting cluster analysis, and it can be used to investigate the inherent grouping in such data.

Code details and examples: Code

Importing Required Libraries:

```python
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd
```

Loading Dataset:

```python
data = pd.read_csv('customers.csv')
```

The input file here would be a csv format file containing customer buying habits with different columns for different attributes.

KMeans Clustering:

```python
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=3)
kmeans.fit(data)
```

This will create 3 clusters from the data. 

To run this code, you can simply copy the required parts and run them in a Python environment. Ensure you have the required libraries (sklearn, matplotlib, pandas) installed and the data file "customers.csv" is available in your working directory.

Command to run:

If the code is saved as a .py file, it can be run from a command line with the following command:

```shell
python3 filename.py
```

Where "filename.py" would be replaced with the name of your Python file.
