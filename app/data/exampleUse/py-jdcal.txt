Use Case: Convert a Julian Date to a proleptic Gregorian date, or vice versa. 

Code details and examples: 

Julian day numbers are used in astronomy to date astronomical observations, thus eliminating the difficulties resulting from the irregular durations of the day in solar time. Julian Dates are simply a continuous count of days and fractions since noon Universal Time on January 1, 4713 BCE.

Example:

Code:
```python
from jdcal import gcal2jd, jd2gcal

# converting a proleptic Gregorian date to a Julian date
year = 2023
month = 7
day = 14
jd = sum(gcal2jd(year, month, day))
print(f"The Julian Date for {day}/{month}/{year} is {jd}")

# converting a Julian date to a proleptic Gregorian date
jd = 2457221.5
date_tuple = jd2gcal(jd, 0)
year = date_tuple[0]
month = date_tuple[1]
day = date_tuple[2]
print(f"The proleptic Gregorian date for JD {jd} is {day}/{month}/{year}")
```

Command to run this code:
```bash
python3 jdcal_example.py
```

The jdcal package does not require any input files. You just need to provide year, month, and day as integers to convert them into a Julian date, and a Julian date to convert it into a proleptic Gregorian date.
