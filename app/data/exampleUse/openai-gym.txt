# Loop 1000 times
for _ in range(1000):
    # Render environment
    env.render()

    # Take a random action
    action = env.action_space.sample()
    observation, reward, done, info = env.step(action)

    # If the game is finished
    if done:
        observation = env.reset()

# Close the environment
env.close()
```
