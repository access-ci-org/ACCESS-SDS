Use Case: R-Sys is a biostatistics software especially noteworthy for its exploratory and descriptive tools. Thus, it is predominantly used in biological and biotechnical research sectors for sequence analysis, gene expression, proteomics and evolutionary analysis

Code details and examples:

Code:
```R
# Importing data in R
mydata <- read.csv("examples.csv")

# Displaying structure of data
str(mydata)

# Occurrence of factors in the data
table(mydata$factor)

# Basic descriptive statistics
summary(mydata)

# Generating a histogram
hist(mydata$var1, breaks=20, main="Histogram", xlab="Variable 1")
```
Input files: "examples.csv" - This is the name of a sample input file that contains the data that needs to be imported. It must be a CSV file with rows and columns of data. Each row represents a case while each column represents a variable.

Specifications and details: The structure of the data shows the type and the first few instances of each variable in the dataframe. The 'table' function provides us with a simple frequency table, while the 'summary' function provides a handful of descriptive statistics that provide an immediate summary of the typical values and spread of each variable. The 'hist' function generates a histogram to provide a visual illustration of the spread and center of a single variable.

Command to run the code: The code can be run by pasting it into the R console and hitting enter. Alternatively, if it's in a script file you can execute it with Rscript or source.

This is assumed the closest possible use for R-Sys. It is not recommended to use this response as an absolute source for R-Sys as it is one of the generic uses of any statistical software.
