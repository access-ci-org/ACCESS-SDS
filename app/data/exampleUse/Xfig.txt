Use Case: Xfig is a software package that allows for interactive drawing and editing of figures. It supports different types of objects including lines, circles, ellipses, arcs, polygons and text. Xfig is used for architectural diagrams, flowcharts, and illustrating scientific papers or reports.

Code Details and Examples:

Code:

Xfig doesn't exactly require a 'code' to operate as it's a graphical, interactive software. Yet, it does support importing and exporting in a variety of file formats, including an inherent Xfig format (.fig). 

Here is an example of a very basic .fig file:

```
#FIG 3.2  Produced by xfig version 3.2.5b

```

This file represents a simple diagram with two arrows and a piece of text.

To open this file with Xfig, simply use:

```
xfig filename.fig
```

You can perform various operations, modifications and add new objects using the graphical interface of Xfig. The above code is generated when you save a Xfig diagram in its inherent format (.fig).
