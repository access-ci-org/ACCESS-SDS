Use Case: ShoRAH (Short Read Assembly into Haplotypes) is a software aimed at the inference of viral population structure from Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) data. It was developed to analyze HIV sequencing data, but can be applied to any rapidly evolving population of sequences.

Code details and examples:

Code: 

Your data should be in FASTQ format. In this format, each sequence is represented by four lines:

Line 1 begins with '@' and is followed by the sequence identifier.
Line 2 is the raw sequence.
Line 3 begins with '+' and is optionally followed by the sequence identifier.
Line 4 encodes the quality values for the sequence in line 2.

Sample Input File:

    @SEQ_ID
    GATTTGGGGTTCAAAGCAGTATCGATCAAATAGTAAATCCATTTGTTCAACTCACAGTTT
    +
    !''*((((***+))%%%++)(%%%%).1***-+*''))**55CCF>>>>>>CCCCCCC65

Command to run:

    ./diri_sampler -j 10 -k 8 -b <inputfile>.sam -a 0.05

This command runs ShoRAH with a window size (j) of 10, a padding (k) of 8, using the input file <inputfile>.sam, and a significance level (a) of 0.05 for statistical tests. The output by default gets dumped into the present working directory.
