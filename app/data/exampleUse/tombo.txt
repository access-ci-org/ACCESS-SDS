Use Case: Tombo is a suite of tools primarily for the identification of modified nucleotides from nanopore sequencing data. This platform can be used to analyse raw signal alignments to reference genomes and detect modification presence on a per-read basis.

Code Details and Examples:

Format Required: There are several types of files required by Tombo. Initially, you need a fast5 files which contain raw nanopore sequencing data. It is also essential to provide a reference genome in the FASTA format to which the raw nanopore reads will be aligned.

Command to Run: Tombo relies on specific commands to carry out its function, here I listed two of the most common ones:

align raw nanopore reads with the 'resquiggle' command:

```
tombo resquiggle path/to/fast5s/ genome.fasta --processes 4
```

Then call modifications with the 'detect_modifications' command:

```   
tombo detect_modifications de_novo --fast5-basedirs path/to/fast5/ --statistics-file-basename path/to/stats --processes 4
```

The 'resquiggle' step aligns raw nanopore reads to the provided reference genome. The 'detect_modifications' step applies statistical tests to the aligned reads and outputs information about potential modified nucleotides.

Sample Input Files:

1. FAST5 files containing raw nanopore sequencing data: These files are generated by the sequencing device itself. They contain the raw current signal measured by the nanopore sequencing device.

2. Reference genome (for example genome.fasta): A sequence file, typically in fasta format, containing the reference sequences to which the raw nanopore reads will be aligned. This can be downloaded from sources such as the NCBI Genome database.

Note: These are examples of basic functionality. Additional command line arguments and data preparation steps (e.g. base calling, alignment) may be required for your specific use case. Please consult the Tombo documentation for more detailed information.
