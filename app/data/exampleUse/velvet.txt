Use Case: Velvet is an algorithm used to assemble short-read sequencing data, especially those produced by de novo genome assembly. 

Code details and examples: 

Input Files: Velvet requires FASTQ or FASTA formatted input files which contain sequence data. They are usually produced by a high-throughput sequencer.

2 Sample Input files:

Sample FASTA input:

    >sequence1
    ATGCAGTGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAG

Sample FASTQ input:

    @sequence2
    ATGCAGTGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAG
    +
    IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII

Specifications and details: The sequence data should not include characters other than A, C, G, T, and N. Velvet can be used with single-end or paired-end data. Please note that Velvet does not support reads longer than 32 kbp.

Code Snippets: 

You can perform genome assembly with Velvet using the `velveth` and `velvetg` commands. The `velveth` command is used to construct a de Bruijn graph, and `velvetg` is used to simplify the graph and extract contigs. Here is sample code:

1. Construct the de Bruijn graph. This step also requires specifying k-mer size (e.g., 31).

    velveth out_dir 31 -fastq -short Paired_end_data.fastq

2. Simplify the graph and extract contigs.

    velvetg out_dir -cov_cutoff auto

Command to Run: 

You can run Velvet by executing the `velveth` and `velvetg` commands in your terminal or command line interface. These commands are normally run in consecutive order. The exact command can vary depending on your sequence data and desired parameters. 

Here is a basic example to run Velvet:

    velveth out_dir 31 -fastq -short Paired_end_data.fastq
    velvetg out_dir -cov_cutoff auto
