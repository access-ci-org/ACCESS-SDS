Use Case: iimpi is a popular software stack used in high performance computing (HPC). It stands for Intel compilers (icc/ifort), Intel MPI, Intel Math Kernel Library (MKL), and Intel Trace Analyzer and Collector. This is often used to compile and run MPI parallelized programs, which are common in scientific computing.

Code details and examples: 

Dependencies: Look for software names like icc, ifort, impi, imkl in the environment module. 

You can compile a C code with the Intel C compiler (icc) in the following way:

- Code:
```bash
module load iimpi
icc my_program.c -o my_program
```

This will produce an executable file named "my_program". You can then use the Intel MPI to run the program on multiple cores. Suppose we want to run the program on 8 cores, we can use the following command:

- Code
```bash
mpirun -np 8 ./my_program
```

The program "my_program.c" must be a c program that's designed for parallel computing with MPI. For example, it can look like this:

- Code:
```C
#include <mpi.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char** argv) {
    MPI_Init(NULL, NULL);

    int world_size;
    MPI_Comm_size(MPI_COMM_WORLD, &world_size);

    int world_rank;
    MPI_Comm_rank(MPI_COMM_WORLD, &world_rank);

    char processor_name[MPI_MAX_PROCESSOR_NAME];
    int name_len;
    MPI_Get_processor_name(processor_name, &name_len);

    printf("Hello world from processor %s, rank %d out of %d processors\n",
           processor_name, world_rank, world_size);

    MPI_Finalize();
}
```

This is a simple hello-world program for MPI. It basically prints out the rank and the total number of processor cores from every process.
