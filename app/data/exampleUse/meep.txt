Use Case: Meep is a Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) simulation software package developed by MIT to model electromagnetic systems. It can be used for light propagation analysis, photonic crystal study, waveguide simulation or optical ring resonator modeling. 

Code details and examples: Code

In Meep, script files are written in Scheme (a dialect of Lisp) or Python. Here's an example of a script to simulate light propagation through a waveguide.

Filename: wg.scm
```scheme
(set! geometry-lattice (make lattice (size 10 10 no-size)))
(set! geometry (list 
  (make block (center 0 0) (size infinity 0.5) 
                 (material (make dielectric (epsilon 12))))))
(set! pml-layers (list (make pml (thickness 1.0))))
(set! sources (list (make source 
  (src (make gaussian-src (frequency 0.15) (fwidth 0.1))) 
  (component Ez) (center -3.5))))
(run-until 200 (at-beginning output-epsilon) 
  (to-appended "ez" (at-every 0.6 output-field-z)))
```
This script defines a computational cell, a dielectric block acting as waveguide, a PML absorbing boundary, a Gaussian source and simulation run function. The simulation outputs are the permittivity distribution and the z-component of the electric field.

Command to run the simulation:
```bash
meep wg.scm
```

The output file 'ez.h5' generated by Meep can be visualized using the h5topng utility from the h5utils package distributed by MIT as well.

Command to convert the output into a png image:
```bash
h5topng ez.h5
```
'ez.png' is the output file representing the electric field inside the waveguide.
