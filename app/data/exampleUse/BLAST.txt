Use Case: BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool) is a popular tool in bioinformatics, widely used for similarity search in sequence databases. It's used for comparing primary biological sequence information, like the amino-acid sequences of proteins or the letters of DNA and/or RNA chains. A typical use case for BLAST is to infer functional and evolutionary relationships between sequences as well as nullifying chance matches.

Code details and examples: 

The input file for BLAST should be in FASTA format. A simple FASTA file looks like this:

```
>seq0
ATGCATGCATGC
>seq1
ATGCATGCAAAA
```

This file contains two sequences: seq0 and seq1. The BLAST command line tool can then be used to find all similar sequences in a given database using the following command:

```
blastp -query input.fasta -db database.fasta -out output.txt
```

Here, `blastp` is used for protein sequence alignments, `-query input.fasta` specifies the input file, `-db database.fasta` specifies the database file to align the query to, and `-out output.txt` specifies the output file.

It should be noted that BLAST command line tool needs to be installed and properly set up for the above command to work. It also presumes that `database.fasta`, the database against which we are blasting, has been properly formatted using the `makeblastdb` tool.
