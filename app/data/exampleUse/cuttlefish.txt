Use Case: Cuttlefish is a software for visualization and analysis of high-dimensional data. It can be used in a variety of applications such as data exploration, clustering, and dimensionality reduction.

Code details and examples: Code. 

Cuttlefish is GUI software and does not have a command line interface. However, it does require specific file formats and specifications for its input files.

Typically, the input to Cuttlefish can be a file in .csv format where each row represents an individual data point and each column represents a feature or dimension of the data.

Make sure that your CSV file includes a header row to label each column(all labels must be unique). Any row with missing data will be excluded from the dataset.

When you start the Cuttlefish software, you'd be asked to select a data file. Navigate to the CSV file from your computer and select.

Once a valid data file has been selected, Cuttlefish will load the data and display a scatter plot.

Alternately, you can load a previously saved Cuttlefish project file (.cfp), which will allow you to view and continue work from a previous session. This file type will load any datasets, visualizations, and filters from the previous session. 

Remember to save your work by clicking File > Save or pressing Ctrl + S to save the project file. Please Note: Saving only saves the project (what datasets, visualizations, filters, etc. are currently loaded) and does not save actual datasets or visualization images.
