Use Case: Use mbuffer to improve the performance of data transfers by avoiding disk I/O bottlenecks. This is useful when transferring large datasets from one system to another over a network.

Code details and examples: Code:

mbuffer is a command-line application that copies standard input to standard output, buffering data in memory to smooth out the data flow and report progress and data throughput.

The input file is usually specified as standard input, thus redirection or pipe is used. Output file is specified with '-o' flag.

Sample Input File:

Let's assume you have a large file named `largefile.dat`

Command to use mbuffer:

```bash
cat largefile.dat | mbuffer -s 128k -m 1G -o outputfile.dat
```

Here, 
'-s 128k' sets the block size to 128 kilobytes.
'-m 1G' sets the maximum memory to be used for buffering to 1 gigabyte.
'-o outputfile.dat' specifies the output file.

Please note that mbuffer does not require a specific file format, it works with raw binary data from standard input to standard output.
