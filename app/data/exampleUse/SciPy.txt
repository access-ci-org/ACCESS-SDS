Use Case: sudoSpectral analysis, mathematical optimization, linear algebra, and generation of random numbers.

Code details and examples: 

Code:

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy import linalg as LA

A = np.array([[1,2],[3,4]])

# Compute the eigenvalues and right eigenvectors of a square array
e_vals, e_vecs = LA.eig(A)

print("Eigenvectors :\n",e_vecs)
print("\nEigenvalues :\n",e_vals)
```

Input format: The array A is inputted as a two-dimensional numpy array. 

Specifications in input files: Matrix A is a 2x2 matrix but can be scaled up to any square matrix. 

Command to run: scipy can be run directly in a Python environment or using command line by:
```bash
python filename.py
```
