Use Case: Spglib is used for finding and handling crystal symmetries. The software can be utilized to simplify the computations of band structure by reducing the k-points and the matrices size of Hamiltonian for electronic structure calculations.

Code details and examples: Code

Here is a sample python program that uses spglib to find the symmetries in a given crystal. The program requires the following input:

- `lattice`: an array representing the crystal's lattice vectors.
- `positions`: an array representing the positions of the atoms in the crystal.
- `numbers`: an array representing the atomic numbers of the atoms.

Sample Input File:

The data input format can be any acceptable structure file (CIF, POSCAR, etc.), and then the data needs to be mapped to the required input as per spglib requirement.

```
# CIF File
data_Vesta

_cell_length_a  3.567
_cell_length_b  3.567
_cell_length_c  3.567

loop_
_atom_site_label    
_atom_site_fract_x
_atom_site_fract_y
_atom_site_fract_z
Si  0  0  0
Si  0.50  0.50  0
```

Python Code Snippet:

```python
import spglib
import numpy as np

lattice = [[1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1]]
positions = [[0, 0, 0], [0.5, 0.5, 0]]
numbers = [14, 14]

dataset = spglib.get_symmetry_dataset((lattice, positions, numbers))

print("space group type: ", dataset['international'])
```

To run this code, simply execute it in a Python environment with spglib and numpy installed.

Command to Run:
`python spglib_example.py`
