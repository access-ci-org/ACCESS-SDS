Use Case: Neusomatic is a deep-learning model for the detection of somatic mutations in cancer genomes. It can be used to identify mutations in single nucleotide polymorphisms, insertions, and deletions from next-generation sequencing data. It requires bam files as input along with the matching reference genomes.

Input Files: neusomatic requires two types of input files - BAM alignment files and the respective reference genome files. The BAM file contains the sequence alignment data and the reference genome file is typically a FASTA file.

1. BAM File: 

A typical BAM file might look something like this:

```
@SQ SN:ref  LN:45
r001    99  ref 7   30  8M2I4M1D3M =   37  39  TTAGATAAAGGATACTG *
r002    0   ref 9   30  3S6M1P1I4M *   0   0   AAAAGATAAGGATA    *
r003    0   ref 9   30  5S6M       *   0   0   GCCTAAGCTAA       * SA:Z:ref,29,-,6H5M,17,0;
r004    0   ref 16  30  6M14N1I5M  *   0   0   ATAGCTTCAGC       *
```

2. Reference Genome File:

A typical FASTA file might look like:

```
>chr1
NNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN
NNNNNNNGATCCACCTGCCTCAGCCTCCCCAAGTAGCTGGGATTACAGG
```

Command to Run: If we have BAM file as tumor.bam, normal.bam and reference file as reference.fasta, the command in a general setting would be:

```
python preprocess.py \
--mode all \
--reference reference.fasta \
--region whole \
--tumor_bam tumor.bam \
--normal_bam normal.bam \
--work workdir \
--scan_workflow scan_WF \
--panel_of_normals VCF file 
``` 

Depending on the system setup and data, additional arguments might need to be added or changed for the command to run successfully, such as adjusting thread count or specifying different directories for input files and output.
