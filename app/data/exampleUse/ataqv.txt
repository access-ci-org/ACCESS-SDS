Use Case: To generate QC metrics for ATAC-seq data using the program 'ataqv'

Code details and examples:

Code:

Before running ataqv, we need to have:

1. An alignment file in BAM format
2. A metrics output filename (JSON format)
3. The reference FASTA for our genome
4. A BED file with the regions of the genome we're interested in.
5. A peaks BED file from the peak caller. 

They can be generated using various tools like Bowtie2, MACS etc.

Suppose we have an alignment file (`aligned_reads.bam`), a reference genome (`ref_genome.fa`), a BED file with regions of interest (`regions.bed`) and a peaks file generated by MACS (`peaks.bed`), and we want to generate the metrics file (`metrics.json`).

Here is a sample code snippet to run ataqv:

```bash
ataqv --metrics-file metrics.json --reference ref_genome.fa --regions regions.bed --peaks peaks.bed aligned_reads.bam
```

In the input BAM file (`aligned_reads.bam`), reads are expected to be paired-end. The reference genome file (`ref_genome.fa`) should be in FASTA format. As for the regions file (`regions.bed`), it should be in standard BED format. The peaks file (`peaks.bed`) can be generated by a peak caller like MACS. 

The resulting metrics file (`metrics.json`) will be a JSON file that can be analyzed using any standard JSON processing tools.
