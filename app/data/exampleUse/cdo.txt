Use Case: CDO (Climate Data Operators) is used to process and analyze climate and forecast model data.

Code Details and Examples:

Input File: NetCDF format

Specifications in the Input File: 
In this example, you have a dataset with longitude, latitude, level and time dimensions.

Command to run:
To calculate the annual mean of a netCDF file:

Code:
```
cdo yearmean input.nc output.nc
```

To calculate the zonal mean:

Code:
```
cdo zonmean input.nc output.nc
```

You can also perform operations such as addition or subtraction on multiple files:

Code:
```
cdo add file1.nc file2.nc output.nc
```

For performing multiplication or division:

Code:
```
cdo mulc,2 input.nc output.nc
```
The above command will multiply all values in the input.nc file by 2.

Please adjust your input.nc,output.nc,file1.nc,file2.nc paths according to your file's order. Also, instead of using '2' in the multiplication command, you can use any desired constant.
