Use Case: Maturin is widely used to build and publish rustic Python extensions. You can use it either in the Rust project as a development tool or in a Python project as a build system. 

Code details and examples: 

Firstly, create a new Python package with Rustyn:

Code:
```
dbus-python = "0.8.1"

[package.metadata.maturin]
requires-dist = ["cffi>=1.0"]

[lib]
name = "dbus_python"
crate-type = ["cdylib"]

[dependencies]
cpython = "0.4"
dbus = "0.8"
```

This specifies that our package will have the same dependencies as dbus-python, and the Rust library will be named dbus_python. 

As input data, maturin uses the setup.py script, which is required to package the library for PyPi. Hereâ€™s how it looks for dbus-python:

Code:
```python
from setuptools import setup, find_packages

setup(
    name="dbus-python",
    version="0.8.1",
    packages=find_packages(),
    install_requires=[
        "cffi>=1.0",
    ],
)
```

To build the package using maturin you would then use the following command:

Code:
```bash
maturin develop
```

This command builds the package and also installs it to your current python interpreter.
