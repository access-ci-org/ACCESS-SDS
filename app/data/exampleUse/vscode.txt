Use Case: Visual Studio Code (VS Code) by Microsoft, is a source-code editor for web and cloud development. It supports a multitude of languages like Python, C++, and Java. Web developers can use VS Code for improving HTML, CSS and JavaScript codebase. Because VS Code includes built-in debugging, it facilitates a simplified debugging experience.

Code Details and Examples:

Code: 

HTML: A simple VS Code snippet for an HTML file will be like this:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Page Title</title>
</head>
<body>

<h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>

</body>
</html>
```

Python:
A simple python code snippet that can be run in VS Code will look like this:
```python
def add(x,y):
    return x+y
print(f"The sum of 5 and 3 is {add(5,3)}")
```

To run the code in VS Code, type `python filename.extension` in the terminal, replace "filename.extension" with your file's name and its extension (for example, `python helloworld.py`).
