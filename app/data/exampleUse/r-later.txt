Use Case: R-later is an R package that provides functions to schedule R commands to run after a specified delay. It is useful when you need to defer the execution of long-running or scheduled tasks.

Code details and examples:

Code:

```R
library(later)

# Print "Hello, world!" 5 seconds from now.
later(function() print('Hello, world!'), delay = 5.0)

# Print "Hello, world!" Also 5 seconds from now. But if the system is busy and it has to choose between running these two, it'll run function2
later(function2() print('Hello, world!'), delay = 5.0, loop = function2)

```

There is no external input file is required. The arguments to the function 'later' are the function to be executed after delay and the delay time in seconds. 

To run the code, save it in a '.R' file and call it from the R command line with the command: Rscript filename.R.
