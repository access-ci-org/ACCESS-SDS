Use Case: Archiving a group of files into a compressed zip file.

Code details and examples:

Code:

```bash
zip archive_name.zip file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt
```

This command zips the files file1.txt, file2.txt, and file3.txt into an archive named archive_name.zip. The input files could be any type of file and there are no specific file format requirements.

To unzip the files, you would use:

```bash
unzip archive_name.zip
```

This will extract the files contained in the zip archive into the current directory.
