Use Case: Rebaler is a tool used for performing fast and accurate reference-based alignments for long-read sequences. It may be used, for instance, in bioinformatics for genome assembly where it realigns reads to match the reference genome.

Code details and examples:

Code: 

For execution, Rebaler requires as input a FASTA file with the reference genome and a FASTQ or FASTA file with the input reads. As an example, suppose the reference file is named 'reference.fasta' and the reads file is named 'reads.fastq'. 

Run the following command:

```
rebaler reference.fasta reads.fastq > output.fasta
```

Here, 'output.fasta' is the output file which will contain your assembled genome.

Input Specifications:

1. 'reference.fasta' - This file should contain your reference genome in FASTA format. 

Sample Input:

```fasta
>Sequence1
ATGCATGCATGCATGCATGCATGCATGCATGCATGCATGC
```

2. 'reads.fastq' - This file contains your input reads. These can be in either FASTA or FASTQ format, and can be either uncompressed, or compressed with gzip (.gz) or bzip2 (.bz2).

Sample Input:

```fasta
@Read1
ATGCATTTTTTGCATGCATGCATGCATGCATGC
+`
IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII
```

This encodes a single read. The '+' separates the read sequence (above) from its quality string (below). Here, each 'I' character represents a base call quality of 30 (in Phred+33 encoding). 

Please be aware that your own input files will be significantly longer and more complex than these simplified examples.
