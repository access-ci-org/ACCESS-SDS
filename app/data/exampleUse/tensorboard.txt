Use Case: TensorBoard is the interface used to visualize TensorFlow runs and experiments. It provides visualization and tooling for machine learning experimentation, including metrics, parameters, and experimental results.

Code details and examples:

Code: 

Suppose you are training a Deep Learning model using Tensorflow and want to monitor the training process, TensorBoard makes this easy. Once your TensorFlow program is running with TensorBoard callbacks configured, you need to launch TensorBoard in a new terminal with a log directory argument pointing to the directory where the callbacks are writing logs.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import datetime

# Clear any logs from previous runs
!rm -rf ./logs/

# Load the TensorBoard notebook extension
%load_ext tensorboard

# Define a simple sequential model
def create_model():
  model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(512, activation='relu', input_shape=(784,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dropout(0.2),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
  ])
  model.compile(optimizer='adam',
                loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy',
                metrics=['accuracy'])

  return model

# Create a basic model instance
model = create_model()

log_dir = "logs/fit/" + datetime.datetime.now().strftime("%Y%m%d-%H%M%S")
tensorboard_callback = tf.keras.callbacks.TensorBoard(log_dir=log_dir, histogram_freq=1)

# Train the model
model.fit(x=train_dataset,
          y=train_labels, 
          epochs=5, 
          validation_data=(test_dataset, test_labels), 
          callbacks=[tensorboard_callback])
```

To run the TensorBoard, you can use the following command in your terminal:

``` shell
tensorboard --logdir=logs/fit
```

Now, you can navigate to the localhost link provided in your terminal output to view the TensorBoard interface.

In this example:

- "train_dataset" and "train_labels" is your training data and its corresponding labels.
- "test_dataset" and "test_labels" is your validation or test data and its corresponding labels.
- "logs/fit/" is the path where you want to save the outputs for visualization in TensorBoard.
