Use Case: The command, `idev`, is a part of the SLURM workload manager in High Performance Computing(HPC). It is used to request an interactive computing session on a compute node, for tasks such as debugging code, running jobs interactively, and developing software.

Code details and examples: 

Code:
```bash
# Request an interactive session on a compute node. Let's say we need a session 
# with 2 cores, 4GB memory and expected runtime of 1 hour.
idev -n 2 -m 4gb -W 60
```

Once you are in the interactive session, you can run your code directly on the command line or use a script.

```bash
# running your code directly on command line
python my_script.py

# or execute your bash script
bash my_script.sh
```

Your my_script.py file could be a simple Python script:
```python
# my_script.py
print("Hello, World!")
```

Whereas the my_script.sh could be a Bash script that executes a program:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# my_script.sh
./my_program
```

Make sure your scripts or programs have the proper permissions to be executed. If not, you can use chmod command:

```bash
chmod +x my_program
```

The command to end the interactive session is `exit`.

```bash
exit
```

Command to run:
```bash
idev -n 2 -m 4gb -W 60
```
