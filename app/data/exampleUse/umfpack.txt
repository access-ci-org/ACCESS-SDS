Use Case: UMFPACK is primarily used for solving unsymmetric sparse linear systems Ax=b using the Unsymmetric MultiFrontal method.

Code details and examples:

Code:

Here's an example of basic usage of `umfpack` in Python with the `scipy` library. The code solves the following system of equations:
    
```python
2x + 3y = 9
x - 4y = -13
```

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.sparse import csc_matrix
from scikits.umfpack import spsolve

# Create a sparse matrix in CSC format
A = csc_matrix(np.array([[2.0, 3.0], [1.0, -4.0]]))

# Create a RHS vector
b = np.array([9.0, -13.0])

# Solve the system
x = spsolve(A, b)

# Print the solution
print(x)
```

The input to the `spsolve` function are the sparse matrix `A` and the right-hand side vector `b`, both defined in the code as numpy arrays. The system of equations is solved and the solution is printed.

The above code should be saved as a Python script (i.e., with a .py extension), and can be run with the command `python script.py` (with script.py being the name of your Python file).
