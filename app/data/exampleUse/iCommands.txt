Use Case: iCommands is a collection of commands for the Integrated Rule-Oriented Data System (iRODS). It can handle data management, sharing, and integration and is used in high-performance computing and data-heavy processing applications.

Code Details and Examples:

Code 1: Standard command to display information about the iRODS system and the user's iRODS account.

Command: ils

The "ils" command lists the contents of a collection. 

```

ils /tempZone/home/rods
/tempZone/home/rods:  
gearRules.json
test1.txt
```

Code 2: Command to upload a file to the iRODS repository.

Command: iput (input, then filename)

iput is used to put a file into iRODS.

Input file: test_file.txt

```
iput test_file.txt
```

Code 3: Command to download a file from the iRODS repository.

Command: iget

iget retrieves a file from the iRODS.

```
iget test_file.txt
```

Remember that these commands can only function in an active iRODS environment - you need to be connected to an iRODS grid.

You can test these commands by creating a dummy text file in the same directory where the commands are run. Make sure that the file names are exactly the same in the commands and actual files.
