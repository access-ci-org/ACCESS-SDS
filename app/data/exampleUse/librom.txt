Use Case: libROM is a library that interfaces with application codes to autonomously create highly accurate and efficient reduced order models, which are used for generalized ROM parameters and quantities of interest. 

Code Details and Examples: Code 

Firstly, the code should be compiled using the C++ compiler. Here is a simple example of how libROM is used to construct a reduced order model. This is done using singular value decomposition (SVD) and a time domain sample mesh:

```c++
#include "libROM.h"
using namespace std;
using namespace CAROM;

int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
    // The dimension of the system.
    int dim = 3;

    // The number of samples.
    int num_samples = 4;

    // Define sample mesh in time domain
    double dt = 0.1;
    double T[num_samples*dim] = {0.0, dt, 2*dt, 3*dt, 0.5, dt+0.5, 2*dt+0.5, 3*dt+0.5, 1.0, dt+1.0, 2*dt+1.0, 3*dt+1.0};

    // Initialize the SVD model.
    BasisGenerator* generator = new SVD(dim, true);

    // Process the sample mesh to construct the reduced order model.
    for (int i = 0; i < num_samples * dim; i++) {
        // The snapshot of the system at time t.
        double* sol = new double[dim];
        for (int j = 0; j < dim; j++) {
            sol[j] = sin(T[i] + j*0.1);
        }
        generator->takeSample(sol, T[i], i);
        delete[] sol;
    }

    generator->endSamples();

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, the SVD method is used to decompose the system into higher and lower modes of operation. The system snapshot at each time point is taken by calling `takeSample()` multiple times. 

After all samples are taken, the `endSamples()` method is then called to complete the sample-taking procedure. This then results in the creation of the reduced order model for the system.

Command to run: `g++ filename.cpp -lrom -o output` [When compiled with g++ compiler and librom is installed system-wide.]
