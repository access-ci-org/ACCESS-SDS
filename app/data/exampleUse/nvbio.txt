Use Case: Use nvbio for high-performance bioinformatics and genomics data analysis. It can specifically be used for processing and analyzing large-scale Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) data; reading and writing FASTA, FASTQ, and SAM files; conversion between these file formats and more. 

Code details and examples: Code 

Sample input file for nvbio is it takes a FASTA or FASTQ file as input which could look something like:

>seq0
CAGTGTGTCAGTGTAGC
>seq1
ACTGTCAGTGAC

The software is used from the command line and does not need specific details in the input file other than formatting, unless a specific method is being used inside the software. 
A typical use might therefore look like:

nvbio fasta2fastq -i seq.fasta -o seq.fastq

To run nvbio with an input file (say "input.fasta"), the command might look something like:

> nvbio sort -i input.fasta -o sorted.fasta

This will sort the sequences in the input.fasta file and output them to sorted.fasta.

There is also a variety of other methods available inside the nvbio for processing sequencing data, such as:

> nvbio fasta2sam -i input.fasta -o output.sam

This command will convert a fasta file into a sam file.

The nvbio suite also includes a variety of other tools and example code snippets for doing more complicated processing and analysis of sequencing data are provided in the nvbio GitHub repository.
