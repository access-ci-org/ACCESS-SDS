Use Case: 

Matplotlib is a python library used for data visualization in 2D/3D plotting. This library is used to create static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python. 

Code Details and Examples:

Code:

```python
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    import numpy as np

    # Creating a sample dataset
    x = np.linspace(0, 2 * np.pi, 400)
    y = np.sin(x ** 2)

    # A figure with just one sub-plot
    fig, ax = plt.subplots()
    ax.plot(x, y)
    ax.set_title('A single plot')

    plt.show()
```

Input File: No specific input file is needed. Here, a range of values for x is created using numpy's linspace function, and a corresponding y is calculated by applying a function to x.

Format Required: As mentioned, we are generating the data within the script itself. However, matplotlib accepts numpy arrays as inputs, so if your inputs are in a file, you'd need to use numpy or pandas to read the file into an array/DataFrame. 

Specifications and Details in Input Files: No specific input file here.

Command to run: If the above code was saved in a file called plot.py, you can run this python file with the command: `python plot.py`
