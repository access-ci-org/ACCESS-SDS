Use Case: Connect to a remote server via SSH and execute a command.

Code Details and Examples: C

Code:

First, include the necessary library:
```C
#include <libssh/libssh.h>
```

You then start by setting up your ssh session and connect to the server:
```C
ssh_session my_ssh_session = ssh_new();
if (my_ssh_session == NULL)
  exit(-1);

ssh_options_set(my_ssh_session, SSH_OPTIONS_HOST, "localhost");

int rc = ssh_connect(my_ssh_session);
if (rc != SSH_OK)
{
  fprintf(stderr, "Error connecting to localhost: %s\n", ssh_get_error(my_ssh_session));
  ssh_free(my_ssh_session);
  exit(-1);
}
```

Then you attempt to authenticate using password:
```C
rc = ssh_userauth_password(my_ssh_session, NULL, "password");
if (rc != SSH_AUTH_SUCCESS)
{
  fprintf(stderr, "Error authenticating with password: %s\n", ssh_get_error(my_ssh_session));
  ssh_disconnect(my_ssh_session);
  ssh_free(my_ssh_session);
  exit(-1);
}
```

Finally, you can execute your command:
```C
ssh_channel channel = ssh_channel_new(my_ssh_session);
if (channel == NULL)
  return SSH_ERROR;

rc = ssh_channel_open_session(channel);
if (rc != SSH_OK)
{
  ssh_channel_free(channel);
  return rc;
}

rc = ssh_channel_request_exec(channel, "ls");
if (rc != SSH_OK)
{
  ssh_channel_close(channel);
  ssh_channel_free(channel);
  return rc;
}

ssh_channel_send_eof(channel);
ssh_channel_close(channel);
ssh_channel_free(channel);
```

You then disconnect and free your session after your command has been executed:
```C
ssh_disconnect(my_ssh_session);
ssh_free(my_ssh_session);
```

Compile and run this program with:
```bash
gcc -o ssh_example ssh_example.c -lssh
./ssh_example
```

In this example, replace "localhost" and "password" with your respective server and password. Also replace "ls" with whichever command you want to execute on the server.
