Use Case: lzma is a compression software often used for compressing large files or directories. 

Code Details and Examples: 

Code:
The input file for lzma is the file or directory we want to compress. There are no specific format requirements as it is independent of the file content.

To compress a file, the command would be:

```sh
lzma -z mybigfile.txt
```

This would create an lzma file named 'mybigfile.txt.lzma'. 


To decompress the file, the command would be:

```sh
lzma -d mybigfile.txt.lzma
```

This would decompress the lzma file and we would have the original 'mybigfile.txt' back.

The `-z` option specifies to compress and the `-d` option specifies to decompress. The only specification is that the file or directory must be existent and lzma must have the necessary permissions to read/write in their location.
