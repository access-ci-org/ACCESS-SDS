Use Case: The Open Solver Interface (OSI) is an interface for calling mathematical programming solvers. This allows you to call different solvers by changing only a few lines of code when you switch from one solver to another. 

Code details and examples: Code:

```python
from coinor.grumpy.polyhedron2D import Polyhedron2D
from coinor.grumpy import generateRandomObjective 
from coinor.opencoin.glpk import GlpkSolver 

A = [[ 2,  0],
     [ 0,  2],
     [ 2,  1]]
b = [50, 200, 300]
c = [1, 1]
solver = GlpkSolver(A = A, b = b, c = c, sense = '=',
                    variable_type = 'C', objective_sense = 'MAX')
solver.solve()

```
Here A is the matrix of coefficients, b is a list of right-hand side values, and c is the list of objective coefficients. Each row in A represents a constraint and each column represents a variable. 

To run this code, use the command python filename.py in a command prompt or terminal, where filename.py is replaced with the name of your Python script. Please make sure you have the necessary packages installed through pip.
