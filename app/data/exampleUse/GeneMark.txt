Use Case: GeneMark is an ab initio gene prediction tool commonly used in bioinformatics for finding protein-coding genes. This tool uses mathematical models that describe pattern and profile of sequences in protein coding genes to detect potential coding regions in genomic data.

Code details and examples:

Input files: GeneMark requires the DNA sequence of a complete or incomplete genome in FASTA format for gene prediction.

Here is an example of what a gene in FASTA format looks like:
```
>seq1
ATAATCTACGTGCTAG...
>seq2
CGTAGCTAGCTACGTGT...
```
The ">" denotes the beginning of each sequence and is followed by a unique id and the nucleotide sequence.

Command to run GeneMark: After the input file is prepared the GeneMark.hmm can be used to analyze it.
```
gmsn.pl --v --fnn --faa --fgenes --fgenesh native.gmhmm.token [organism type] [FASTA input file name]
```
In this case:

--v is to run GeneMark in the verbose mode

--fnn outputs predicted genes in nucleotide sequence (FASTA format)

--faa outputs predicted genes in amino acid sequence (FASTA format)

--fgenes outputs gene coordinate

--fgenesh outputs gene structure

native.gmhmm.token is the token name for GeneMark.hmm model parameters

[organism type] is the type of the organism

[FASTA input file name] is the name of your input file
