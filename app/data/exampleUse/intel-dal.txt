Use Case: Intel Data Analytics Library (DAL)

Code details and examples:
Intel DAL is a library for data analytics provided by Intel. It includes optimizations for Intel architectures and is useful for accelerating data analytics workloads.

Sample input file format:
Input files for Intel DAL may vary depending on the specific data analytics task being performed. They can be in formats such as CSV, Parquet, or other common data formats.

Sample code snippet:
```python
import pandas as pd
from intel_dal import analytics

# Load data
data = pd.read_csv('data.csv')

# Perform data analytics task using Intel DAL
result = analytics.process_data(data)

print(result)
```

Note: The above code is a simplified example and may not reflect the actual API of Intel DAL as it is a hypothetical library.

Command to run:
Since Intel DAL is a hypothetical library, the command to run the code above is also hypothetical. You would typically run a Python script containing the code snippet using the following command:
```bash
python my_script.py
```
