**Use Case:** MATLAB

MATLAB is a high-performance language for technical computing. It integrates computation, visualization, and programming in an easy-to-use environment where problems and solutions are expressed in common mathematical notation.

**Code Details and Examples:**

**Code 1: Basic Plotting**
```
% files with .m extension
% sample.m

% Define the range of x
x = -10:0.1:10;
% Define the function
y = sin(x);
% Create the plot
plot(x,y)
```
This script creates a line-chart of the mathematical function y=sin(x). Input is a range of x that is from -10 to 10 with a step size of 0.1. The x, y variables are defined in the respective lines in the script.

To run this script, type following command in MATLAB command prompt: 
```run('sample.m')```

**Code 2: Matrix Operations**
```
% files with .m extension
% matrix_sample.m

% Define the matrices
A = [1, 2, 3; 4, 5, 6; 7, 8, 9];
B = [1, 0, 1; 0, 1, 0; 1, 0, 1];

% Add the matrices
C = A + B;
% Print the result
disp(C)

```
This script initializes two matrices, A and B, and adds them together. The result is printed to the MATLAB command prompt.

To run this script, type following command in MATLAB command prompt:
```run('matrix_sample.m')```
