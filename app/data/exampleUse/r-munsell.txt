Use Case: The R "munsell" package is a tool for managing colors by the Munsell color system. This package provides easy ways to manipulate Munsell colors and includes a palette of colors that are perceptually even according to the Munsell color system.

Code details and examples:

Code:

```R
# Load the munsell library
library(munsell)

# Define a Munsell color
my_color <- mnsl("5BG 5/10")

# Convert Munsell color to RGB
rgb_color <- mnsl2rgb(my_color)

# Convert RGB color to Munsell
mns_color <- rgb2mnsl(rgb_color)

# Get the hue, value, and chroma of a Munsell color
hue <- get_hue(my_color)
value <- get_value(my_color)
chroma <- get_chroma(my_color)
```

Command to run:

Typically, R scripts are run from the R console with the source() function. The following command assumes that the script is saved in a file named "color_script.R" in the current working directory.

```R
source("color_script.R")
``` 

In the case of working with RStudio, just press the "Source" button in the upper right corner in the script tab to run the code.

Note that this doesn't have any specific input file format requirements, as all the data here is directly provided in the script. The colors used by the `mnsl()` function are in the Munsell color format of "{Hue} {Value}/{Chroma}", where Hue is a character string representing color hue, Value is a number representing color lightness, and Chroma is a number representing color intensity.
