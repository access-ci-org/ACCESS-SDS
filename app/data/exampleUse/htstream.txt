Use Case: Bioinformatics data processing

Code details and examples:

HTStream is a stream based data processing suite, intended to be used in bioinformatics pipelines. It can work off piping in between steps for reduction in data I/O. It supports FASTQ format.

Code:

# Input File: fastqc sequence data
# Input File Format: FASTQ
# Specifications: Paired end sequence data 

## Sample Input:
```
@SEQ_ID
GATTTGGGGTTCAAAGCAGTATCGATCAAATAGTAAATCCATTTGTTCAACTCACAGTTT
+
!''*((((***+))%%%++)(%%%%).1***-+*''))**55CCF>>>>>>CCCCCCC65
```

# Super-Deduper: Removes PCR duplicates
```
hts_SuperDeduper -1 Sample_R1.fastq -2 Sample_R2.fastq -o outputprefix
```

# Overlapper: Merges paired end reads
```
hts_Overlapper -1 Sample_R1.fastq -2 Sample_R2.fastq -o outputprefix
```

# Quality trimmer: Trim low quality reads
```
hts_QWindowTrim -1 Sample_R1.fastq -2 Sample_R2.fastq -o outputprefix
```

The prefix for the naming of the output files has to be added in the `-o` parameter. The command syntax `-1` and `-2` is for paired end sequence data. If working with single end data, then `-U` can be used. All commands require specification of input and output file formats.
