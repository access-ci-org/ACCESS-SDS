Use Case: The GNU Compiler Collection (gcc) includes front ends for C, C++, Objective-C, Fortran, Ada, and Go. These front ends can be used for multiple purposes such as software development, creating executable files, debugging program code and more. For this example, let's use gcc in a basic C program compilation use case.

Code details and examples:

Code:

Save this C program as 'helloworld.c'

```C
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
   printf("Hello World\n");
   return 0;
}
```

Format Required: The program should be in a C source file (.c extension).

To compile the C program above; open terminal (command prompt) in the directory where you've saved 'helloworld.c', then run the command below:

Command:

`gcc helloworld.c -o helloworld`

This will create an executable file named 'helloworld' in the same directory.

To run the compiled program, use the command below:

Command:

`./helloworld`
