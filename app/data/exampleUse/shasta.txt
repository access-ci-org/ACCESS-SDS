Use Case: Use Shasta for rapid de novo assembly of long, noisy DNA sequences, typically generated in high-throughput sequencing (HTS) experiments. Shasta is used in bioinformatics pipelines for assembling genomes and other large DNA constructs.

Code details and examples: Code 

As input, Shasta uses a read file in FASTQ format. The format required for the input file is as follows:

```
@<sequence identifier>
<sequence>
+<quality scores identifier>
<quality scores>
```
An example of a FASTQ input file:
```
@Sequence1
AGCTTAGCTAGCTACCTGGTCTTCTGGCGCGCATTAACC
+Sequence1
!"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
```

To run Shasta with an input file, you would use the following command:

```bash
shasta --input reads.fastq
```

This command will run Shasta with the default parameters and the provided input file "reads.fastq". This commad will generate a.fasta output file containing the assembled sequences.
