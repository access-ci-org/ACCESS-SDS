Use Case: Genrich is frequently used in genomics, where it helps in detecting and identifying genomic sites that are uniquely covered by next-generation sequencing reads. Such sites could be potential binding sites for proteins, locations of DNA or RNA modifications, or regions susceptible to chromosomal breakages.

Code details and examples: 
Code:

Input files required for Genrich are alignment files in BAM or CRAM format. The reads in these files should have been preprocessed (cleaned, filtered, aligned, etc.) according to standard next-generation sequencing practices.

In case you wish Genrich to analyze paired-end data, that should be represented as paired reads in the input alignment file(s), not as two separate files of first mate and second mate alignments.

An example of a command:

```
./Genrich -t file1.bam,file2.bam -o output.narrowPeak
```

Here, the `-t` parameter defines the treatment alignment files, `-o` specifies the output name and format. Genrich supports two output formats: narrowPeak and bed.

The output in the narrowPeak format contains information about the detected genomic sites such as their genomic coordinates, enrichment scores, and q-values for statistical significance. The q-values are calculated from p-values using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure to control the false discovery rate.

For more complex analyses, Genrich provides additional options, including signal track generation, ATAC-seq mode, and control for replication.

For example, you can use -j parameter to enable ATAC-seq mode:
```
./Genrich -j -t file1.bam,file2.bam -o output.narrowPeak
```
Note: Replace "file1.bam, file2.bam" with the paths to your sample bam files.
