Use Case: FASTQ format is a text-based format for storing both a biological sequence and its corresponding quality scores. It is often used in bioinformatics pipelines for sequencing and aligning.

Code Details and Examples: 

Code:
FastQ files do not require any specific command to run them. They are input files used for various tools. Here is a sample FastQ file format and description:

```
@SEQ_ID
GATTTGGGGTTCAAAGCAGTATCGATCAAATAGTAAATCCATTTGTTCAACTCACAGTTT
+
!''*((((***+))%%%++)(%%%%).1***-+*''))**55CCF>>>>>>CCCCCCC65
```
Each FastQ entry consists of four lines:
1. Sequence identifier, starting with @.
2. Nucleotide sequence.
3. Line starting with '+' and optionally, the same sequence identifier.
4. Quality scores of the nucleotide sequence.

These files are primarily used for sequence analysis programs like BLAST, BWA, etc.

For example, if you were to map these reads to a reference using BWA:

```
bwa mem reference.fasta sample.fastq > output.sam
```

This command aligns the sequences in sample.fastq to the reference genome stored in reference.fasta. The resulting alignments are saved in the SAM format file output.sam. BWA is a widely used program in bioinformatics for aligning sequencing reads to a reference genome.
