Use Case: CellPhoneDB is a publicly available repository of curated receptors, ligands and their interactions. Subunit architecture is considered for both ligands and receptors, representing hetero-dimeric ligands and both hetero-dimeric and hetero-multimeric receptors. It is typically used for inferring cell-cell communication from scRNA-Seq data.

Code details and examples:

Code:

Input File: A typical input file is a text file containing counts in a genes (rows) x cells (columns) format. The first row should contain cell type identification, and the first column should contain gene names.

Example:
```
    Cell1 Cell2 Cell3
Gene1    10   20   30
Gene2    40   50   60
Gene3    70   80   90
```

In addition, a metadata file with cell type identification per cell is required.

Example:
```
Cell    Cluster
Cell1   Type1
Cell2   Type2
Cell3   Type3
```

Command to Run: Below is a simple command on how to run cell phone DB with a significant threshold of 0.05.

```
$ cellphonedb method statistical_analysis yourmetafile yourcountsfile --threshold=0.05
```

In the command, replace `yourmetafile` with the name of your metadata file and `yourcountsfile` with the name of your counts file.

In the case of Python, you must first import the necessary cellphonedb module. An example of how to do this is shown below:

```python
from cellphonedb.src.app.app_logger import app_logger
from cellphonedb.src.app.cellphonedb_app import cellphonedb_app

cellphonedb_app.create_app(app_logger).run(meta_filename='yourmetafile', count_filename='yourcountsfile', iterations=1000, threshold=0.05)
```
