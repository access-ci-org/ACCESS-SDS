Use Case: DNApeler is used for assembling sequences of DNA, from complex genomes to single cells. 

Code details and examples: Code

For example, consider this FASTQ file with the following content, named `sample.fastq`:

```
@SEQ_ID
AGTTTGGGTTTACAGGTTTGGGATTAAAGG
+
!''*((((***+))%%%++))(++))(---),,)

@SEQ_ID2
TGAATTGCTTGTGTACTTGTGCTGTTGTGTGTTAGTGCTGTTGTGTGCTTTGTTAGTGTG
+
!''*((((***+))%%%++))(!!'))%%%((!'))%%%++))(!!'))%%%((!'))%%%++))(!''*((((***+))%%%++))
```

To assemble the sequences using DNApeler, your command would look something like this in the terminal:

```
dnaspeler -i sample.fastq -o output.fasta
```

This command takes the input file `sample.fastq`, assembles the sequences and then outputs the assembled sequences to `output.fasta`.

The input file should be in FASTQ format, a text-based format for storing both a biological sequence (usually nucleotide sequence) and its corresponding quality scores. Both the sequence character and quality score are each encoded with a single ASCII character for brevity. It was originally developed at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute to bundle a sequence and its quality data, but has now become the de facto standard for storing the output of high-throughput sequencing machines.
