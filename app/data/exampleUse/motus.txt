Use Case: Motus is a bioinformatics tool often used for the estimation of operational taxonomic units' (OTUs) abundance in metagenomic datasets and it leverages precompiled microbial gene catalogs for a more accurateDNA taxonomic profiling. 

Code details and examples: Code 

Inputs: metagenomic shotgun sequencing data in fastq format.

Create an input directory and place your fastq files in it.
```
mkdir input
cp your_sample.fastq input/
```

Command to run Motus:

`motus mOTU -o output_file.txt -i input/your_sample.fastq`

Samples of input files: 
Fastq file (an extremely simplified version)

```
@SEQ_ID
GATTTGGGGTTCAAAGCAG
+
!''*((((***+))%%%+
@SEQ_ID2
TATTTGGGGTTCAAAGTAG
+
!''*((((***+))%%%
```

Specific specifications and details: The fastq files should contain sequencing data and will usually have millions of lines like the one shown above. Each sequence has an ID line starting with '@', a sequence line containing bases (ACTGs), a '+' line, and a quality score line containing ASCII characters. 

Note: The command to run Motus shown above is quite simple, but usually additional arguments and parameters would be used for a real dataset. 

Moreover, I just give a very brief example here. Actual running need to follow the exact instruction on the Motus official github page (https://github.com/motu-tool/mOTUs_v2) and need to install other dependencies and databases.
