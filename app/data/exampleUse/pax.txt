Use Case: Use pax for archiving and extracting files in Unix-like systems. Pax is specifically useful when there is a need to handle files and directories in a flexible manner or when there is a need for better performance due to limitations of other tools such as tar and cpio.

Code details and examples: 

Code:
pax allows one to specify the names of the files to be archived, which can be done in one of two ways: either by directly listing the filenames in the command line or by using a file contains the list of filenames (using -f option).

For example, the following command creates an archive of files in the current directory and its subdirectories:

```bash
pax -wvf archive.pax .
```
The 'w' option tells pax to write an archive, 'v' tells pax to list the files processed, and 'f archive.pax' directs the archive output to a file named archive.pax.

The input in this case does not need specific format, it only needs correct file paths based on your system specifications.

The below code extract files from the archive:
```bash
pax -rvf archive.pax
```
'r' tells pax to read the archive, 'v' tells pax to list the files it hits upon and 'f archive.pax' specifies the name of the archive file in use. 

Note that both above codes are run in the command line or terminal window. No external input files required.
