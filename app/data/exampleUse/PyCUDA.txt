Use Case: PyCUDA is a Python library often used in scientific applications to execute simple, low-level GPU computations that require high-performance computation. It essentially provides a user-friendly interface to NVIDIA's CUDA parallel computation API.

Code details and examples:

Code:

```python
# Start PyCUDA import process and GPU setup
import pycuda.autoinit
import pycuda.driver as drv
import numpy

# Define a simple kernel function in CUDA C
from pycuda.compiler import SourceModule
mod = SourceModule("""
    __global__ void multiply_them(float *dest, float *a, float *b)
    {
      const int i = threadIdx.x;
      dest[i] = a[i] * b[i];
    }
    """)

# Set up our CPU array
a = numpy.random.randn(400).astype(numpy.float32)
b = numpy.random.randn(400).astype(numpy.float32)

# Set up our destination GPU array
dest = numpy.zeros_like(a)

# Obtain function pointer to our 'multiply_them' kernel
multiply_them = mod.get_function("multiply_them")

# Call the function, specifying grid and block dimensions, and input
multiply_them(drv.Out(dest), drv.In(a), drv.In(b), block=(400,1,1), grid=(1,1))

print(dest-a*b)
```

The command to run them:

```bash
python pycuda_sample.py
```

Specifications and details in input files:

PyCUDA requires input to be in the form of numpy arrays. The numpy arrays a and b are created and filled with random numbers. The numpy array dest is created to hold the result of the multiplication of a and b on the device.

The command block=(400,1,1), grid=(1,1) tells the GPU how to subdivide the data. In this case, array a and b, which are of length 400, are divided into 400 blocks, each of which contains 1 thread. Since each thread corresponds to one element in the array, each block thus has 1 element. For larger problem sizes, one would typically make use of multiple blocks, each of which contains several threads.
