Use Case: Use Rosetta for protein structure prediction and design.

Code details and examples:

Code: The Rosetta commands are generally present in a Rosetta script (.xml). You will definitely need a PDB file (Protein Data Bank file format), where the protein sequence and structure are described. The PDB format is a text file describing the names, positions, and connectivity of atoms in a protein.

Here is an example of a simple Rosetta script for protein structure prediction using the `rosetta_scripts.default.linuxgccrelease` executable.

```sh
./rosetta_scripts.default.linuxgccrelease -s input.pdb -parser:protocol protocol.xml
```

In this case, `input.pdb` is your initial structure file and `protocol.xml` is your Rosetta script. 

Here's an example of format in the `input.pdb` file:

```pdb
ATOM      1  N   ALA A   1      12.106  13.225   5.622  1.00  0.00           N
ATOM      2  CA  ALA A   1      12.901  14.320   5.211  1.00  0.00           C
ATOM      3  C   ALA A   1      14.286  13.791   5.466  1.00  0.00           C
ATOM      4  O   ALA A   1      15.021  14.369   6.226  1.00  0.00           O
ATOM      5  CB  ALA A   1      12.203  15.316   6.101  1.00  0.00           C
```

The `protocol.xml` might look like this:

```xml
<ROSETTASCRIPTS>
  <SCOREFXNS>
  </SCOREFXNS>
  <RESIDUE_SELECTORS>
  </RESIDUE_SELECTORS>
  <TASKOPERATIONS>
  </TASKOPERATIONS>
  <FILTERS>
  </FILTERS>
  <MOVERS>
  </MOVERS>
  <PROTOCOLS>
  </PROTOCOLS>
</ROSETTASCRIPTS>
```

If more detailed examples are required, please refer directly to the Rosetta documentation. All the necessary details and commands should be described there.
