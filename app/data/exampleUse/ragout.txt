Use Case: Ragout is a tool to perform reference-assisted genome assembly. It allows building a target (query) genome based on known structures of related (reference) genomes. The user would provide a "recipe" file as the main input, which describes available data and desired structure of the result. 

Code details and examples: 

Recipe file format:

```
references
  ref1=path/to/reference1
  ref2=path/to/reference2
targets
  tgt=path/to/target
```

Run command:

```ragout.py recipe.txt```

Note:
- The tags 'references' and 'targets' are mandatory and should appear exactly once.
- The paths can be relative or absolute and should point to FASTA files that could be potentially compressed with gzip.
- Multiple reference and target genomes are supported, you can specify as many as you need.
