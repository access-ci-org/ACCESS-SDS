Use Case: Use spice server for virtual machine display access. Specifically, for running a display for a QEMU virtual machine.

Code details and examples: Code.

- Create a file named "myvm.sh"
First, create a script file using any text editor.

```bash
nano myvm.sh
```

- Then, put this content into the file "myvm.sh"
```bash
#!/bin/bash
qemu-system-x86_64 \
    -spice port=5900,addr=127.0.0.1,disable-ticketing \
    -drive file=my_vm_image.qcow2
```
Save the file and exit the text editor. Make the script executable
```bash
chmod +x myvm.sh
```

- Run your script
This is the command to run the Spice server.
```bash
./myvm.sh
```
- You can connect to your VM using any Spice client, for example, spicy which can be invoked from the command line.
```bash
spicy -h 127.0.0.1 -p 5900
```

### Required/Expected format
- "my_vm_image.qcow2" is an example for a virtual machine hard drive image. The expected format is qcow2 but it also could be raw.

### Note
- The server listens on address 127.0.0.1 port 5900 and anyone can connect without a password due to "disable-ticketing".
- You must replace "my_vm_image.qcow2" with your actual VM image path and filename.

You could also use the "-spice ... " line above with any QEMU command line that starts a VM.
