Use Case: HarfBuzz is an open-source text shaping engine used in various operating systems, web browsers, and other text rendering applications. It takes Unicode text, OpenType font as inputs, processes it and provides glyph indices and positions that can be drawn by a graphic library. 

Code details and examples:

Format required: Unicode Text data, OpenType font file

Sample Input Files
1. Text Data: "Hello, World!"
2. OpenType Font file: "Example.otf"

Specifications and Details in Input Files:
1. "Hello, World!" - a simple example of Unicode text.
2. "Example.otf" - OpenType font file which contains information about styling of text(data like font size, font family, etc).

Python Code Snippet using harfpy (Python bindings for HarfBuzz)

```python
from harfpy import Harfbuzz as hb
from PIL import ImageFont, Image, ImageDraw

def harfbuzz_test():
    face = hb.Face('Example.otf')
    font = hb.Font(face)
    buf = hb.Buffer()
    buf.add_str('Hello, World!')
    buf.shape(font)
    glyph_infos, glyph_positions = buf.get_glyphs()
    for info, pos in zip(glyph_infos, glyph_positions):
        print(info.codepoint, pos.x_advance, pos.y_advance, pos.x_offset, pos.y_offset)

font = ImageFont.truetype("Example.otf", 20)
img = Image.new("RGB", (200, 200), "white")
draw = ImageDraw.Draw(img)
draw.text((50, 70), "Hello, World!", "black", font)
img.save("output.png")

```
Command: python harfbuzz_test.py
Note: Make sure Python, PIL, and harfpy are installed and the used font file is present in the directory from where the script is being executed.
