Use Case: VTune Profiler, developed by Intel, is widely used to analyze the runtime and performance of applications.

Code details and examples:

Code: The following steps explain the usage of VTune Profiler.

Step 1: Obtain a binary file that supports VTune output. You can use the Intel Compiler to compile your source code with the -g option:

```shell
$ icc -g myfile.c -o myfile
```

This will output a binary "myfile" that contains all the debugging information needed by VTune.

Step 2: Open VTune Profiler.

Step 3: In the VTune project navigator, click the "New Project" button. This will bring up a dialog box. Enter a project name and browse to the location of your binary file. Click "OK."

Step 4: Now you can create a new Analysis Activity. Select the binary for analysis and set the Analysis type to "Hotspots by CPU Utilization," then click the "Start" button.

```shell
$ amplxe-cl -collect hotspots ./myfile
```

VTune Profiler will then run your binary and collect data about CPU Utilization.

Step 5: Once VTune Profiler has finished running your binary, it will display a summary of the analysis results. 

The input file is the binary executable created from your original source code, and the format used for the input file is a standard binary executable format, usually .exe or .out.

The specifications in the input files include standard debugging information produced by the Intel Compiler.

Running the Intel VTune Profiler requires the binary executable file (produced from the source code by the Intel Compiler icc). Therefore the binary file is a prerequisite to running the application.
