Use Case: Using `R-progress` to track the progress of a long running for loop in a scientific computation task using R.

Code Details and Examples: Code

**Initialization:**
First, import the progress and the sample data:

```R
library(progress)

n <- 1e5
```

**Sample Input File:**
None required. 

**Format: Format required for the input file:**
No input file is necessary as the data is directly generated in the program.

**Any specifications and details in input files:**
No input file is needed for this example.

**Sample Code:**

```R
pb <- progress_bar$new(total = n)
for(i in seq_len(n)) {
  pb$tick()
}
```
In the above example, the progress of the loop executing 1e5 times is tracked using the progress bar.

**Command to run**

The above code can be run in RStudio or in an R shell. To run it, simply copy and paste the code into the appropriate R environment and hit enter.

After you copied and pasted entire code and hit Enter, you will see something like this in the console.

```R
  |=============================================================  | 98%
```
This is the display of `R-progress` showing the completion status of the operation. It will keep updating as the task progresses.
