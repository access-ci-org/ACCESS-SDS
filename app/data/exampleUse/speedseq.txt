Use Case: Use;
SpeedSeq is an open-source genome analysis platform designed for fast processing of sequencing reads. It is capable of performing tasks such as alignment, variant detection, and functional annotation of variants.

Code Details and Examples: Code;

1. Example for genome alignment with SpeedSeq:

Input Files: This requires two files - the reference genome file (in FASTA format) and the sequence reads file (in FASTQ format).

```
# Input files
ref_genome.fasta
sequence_reads.fastq
```

Command to run:

```
speedseq align -o output -R "@RG\tID:id\tSM:samplename\tLB:lib" ref_genome.fasta sequence_reads.fastq
```

2. Example for variant calling with SpeedSeq:

Input Files: This requires the aligned reads file (in BAM format) and the reference genome file (in FASTA format).

```
# Input files
aligned_reads.bam
ref_genome.fasta
```

Command to run:

```
speedseq var -o output.vcf ref_genome.fasta aligned_reads.bam 
```

Please note that in the above examples, `output`, `output.vcf` , `id`, `samplename`, `lib`, `ref_genome.fasta` and `sequence_reads.fastq` are placeholder names and should be replaced with actual file names/path and appropriate values as per user requirement.
