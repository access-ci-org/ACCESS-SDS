Use Case: VariScan is a bioinformatics tool that has been designed for the study of the polymorphism in sequence data of Dna. It can be used to discover variant calls in the event of any combination of pair-end, single, or multi-normals.

Code details and examples:

Code: 

VarScan is a command line tool, which is being called with an example command script.

```bash
java -jar VarScan.jar mpileup2snp myData.mpileup --min-var-freq 0.01 --variants
```

VarScan reads the input from a mpileup formatted file. An mpileup file can be generated by other command line tools such as samtools. 

Sample input file myData.mpileup:

```
chr1 10000 T 1 ^]4 = 
chr1 10001 T 1 . = 
chr1 10002 A 1 . = 
chr1 10003 C 2 .. ##
chr1 10004 G 2 g. ##
```

Details:
The first column is the name of the chromosome, the second one is the position, the third is the reference base, the fourth is read depth (the number of bases piled up at this position), the fifth is read bases and the sixth is base qualities. The pileup format is explained in more detail in the samtools documentation.

Specifications: 
Specification to the script includes a mpileup formatted file and optional flags. One such optional flag in this script is `--min-var-freq`, which is the minimum variant frequency threshold, and `--variants`, a flag to only output variant (i.e. non-reference and non-consensus) sites.
