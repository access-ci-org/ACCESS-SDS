Use Case: Blender can be used for creating animated films, visual effects, art, 3D printed models, interactive 3D applications and video games. It can also be utilized for creating complex 3D models from basic geometric shapes.

Code details and examples:

Code:

Blender does not rely on traditional coding, but rather on a graphical user interface and the user's input to shape and mold 3D objects. It does, however, support scripting and macros through Python. Here's an example of a simple script that creates a mesh object:

```python
import bpy
import bmesh

#Create new mesh object
mesh = bpy.data.meshes.new("TestMesh")

#Link mesh to scene
obj = bpy.data.objects.new("TestObject", mesh)
bpy.context.scene.collection.objects.link(obj)

#Set mesh to object mode
bpy.context.view_layer.objects.active = obj
obj.select_set(True)

#Create bmesh object and transfer to mesh
bm = bmesh.new()
bmesh.ops.create_cube(bm, size=1.0)
bm.to_mesh(mesh)
bm.free()
```

Command to execute code:

You can paste this into the text editor in Blender and then click on 'Run Script' or use the command `bpy.ops.text.run_script()` in the Python console. 

Input file:

Blender supports a wide variety of file formats for both import and export. Some of these file formats include .blend, .3ds, .fbx, .obj, .x3d and more.

Format required:

If you are importing or exporting 3D models, they typically need to be in a file format that Blender understands. This might be a .blend file (Blender's default file format), an .fbx file, an .obj file or others.

Specifications and details in input files:

The specifications and details of the input file depend heavily on what you're trying to do. For example, if you're importing a 3D model, the input file would need to contain all the data that describes that model, such as its vertices, edges, faces, colors, textures and so on. 

However, if you're writing a Python script, the script file would contain the code for whatever operation you're trying to perform in Blender. This might involve creating or modifying 3D objects, changing the scene's lighting or camera, animating objects, etc.
