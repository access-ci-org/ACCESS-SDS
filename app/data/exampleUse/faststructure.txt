Use Case: fastSTRUCTURE is a tool for population genetic analyses to identify hidden population structures using genotype data. It is commonly used in population genetics, bioinformatics and ecology to study structuring within the population.

Code Details and Examples: 

The first step in using fastSTRUCTURE is to have your input data file in a certain format. The input ought to be in a PLINK "bed/bim/fam" format or a plain genotype file. If it's not, you must convert it. An example of a Plink format looks like:

```
1 rs1 0 5000650 A G
1 rs2 0 5000833 A C
```
The commands for running the process are shown in the shell script below:

Code:
```sh
#!/bin/bash

DATADIR=/path/to/your/data
STRUCTUREDIR=/path/to/faststructure
KVALS=(1 2 3 4 5 6)

## Runs fastStructure for a range of K values

cd $DATADIR

for K in "${KVALS[@]}"
do
    python $STRUCTUREDIR/structure.py -K $K --input=$DATADIR/yourdata --output=$DATADIR/output_K$K --full
    python $STRUCTUREDIR/distruct.py -K $K --input=$DATADIR/output_K$K --output=$DATADIR/output_plot_K$K
done
```
Replace /path/to/your/data with the path to the place where your data files are stored and /path/to/faststructure with the path to the place where faststructure is installed.

Also, replace 'yourdata' with the base name of your input files and the K values should be adjusted according to the number of populations you would postulate could exist given your biological knowledge of the samples.
