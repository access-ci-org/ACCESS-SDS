Code details and examples: Code

For JavaScript, ISA is implemented using a module which can be imported and utilized in a project.

Sample input:

> const { Investigate, Standardize, Align } = require('isa');
>
> const data = [
>   {datetime:'2019-01-01', value:100},
>   {datetime:'2018-01-01', value:50},
>   {datetime:'2017-01-01', value:75}
> ];

In this input, an array of JavaScript objects is provided where each object has a `datetime` and `value` property. `datetime` is a string that represents a date and the value is a numerical data value.

Command to run: 

> var result = new Investigate(data).result;
> console.log(result);
