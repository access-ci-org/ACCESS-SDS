Use Case: Py-xlrd is a library for developers to use to mainly extract data from MS Excel like .xls and .xlsx files. It provides a way to read excel worksheets with rich information. 

Code details and examples:

Code:
```python
import xlrd

workbook = xlrd.open_workbook("sample.xls")
worksheet = workbook.sheet_by_index(0)

for row in range(worksheet.nrows):
    for column in range(worksheet.ncols):
        print(worksheet.cell(row, column).value, end=" ")
    print()
```
In this example, we use py-xlrd to read 'sample.xls', which can be any excel file, and then print the data of each cell in console. The input is the path to the excel file ("sample.xls").

To run it, you just need to run it with python in command line:

```shell
python script.py
``` 

where script.py is the file contains the code. 

Please note the file to be read ('sample.xls' in this case) should be in the same directory of script.py or the absolute path of the file should be given.
