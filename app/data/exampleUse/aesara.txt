Use Case: Aesara is a Python library that allows you to define, optimize, and evaluate mathematical expressions involving multi-dimensional arrays efficiently. It could be used for large-scale computations and can be applied in fields such as deep learning research.

Code Details and Examples: 

Code:

`
import aesara
from aesara import tensor as T

# Define a scalar (0-d) variable
x = T.scalar('x')

# Define a mathematical expression
y = x ** 2

# Convert the expression into a callable object
f = aesara.function([x], y)

# Use the function
output = f(3)

print(output)  # output: 9.0

# Define two vector (1-d) variables
x = T.vector('x')
y = T.vector('y')

# Define a mathematical expression
z = x + y

# Convert the expression into a callable object
f = aesara.function([x, y], z)

# Use the function
output = f([1, 2], [3, 4])

print(output)  # output: array([4., 6.])

`
Command to Run: 
This Python code can be run with a python compiler or just use the command python filename.py on the command line. For the second command, replace filename with the name of your python file. 

Input Files: 
This example does not require any input files as all inputs are provided directly in the code.

Specifications and Details in Input Files: 
No input file is required hence no specifications needed. 

Note: Aesara follows the same syntax as Numpy and Python and requires same or similar data structures. Hence, it is easier for users already familiar with Numpy/Python.
