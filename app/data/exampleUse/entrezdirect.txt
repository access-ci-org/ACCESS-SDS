efetch -db nucleotide -id AF086833 -format fasta > sequence.fasta
```

Input files:

N/A

Command to run them: 

```
bash script.sh

In this script, `efetch` is a command line utility provided by the EntrezDirect package. It fetches and downloads data from a variety of NCBI databases. In this case, we are interacting with the `nucleotide` database. The `-id` flag is followed by the accession number of the sequence we want to retrieve. The `-format fasta` tells `efetch` we want the sequence data in FASTA format. Finally, the output is redirected to a file called `sequence.fasta`.
