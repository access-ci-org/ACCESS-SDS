Use Case: Use VPL for creating programming lab assignments for educational purposes. It allows the entire class to check their assignments and submits their code in a secure environment. 

Code details and examples: Code:

The following is an example of a VPL environment to run a Python program to calculate the factorial of a number.

1. You create a file named `vpl_execution` with the following content:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
python3 factorial.py
```

This file instructs VPL to execute the `factorial.py` Python script.

2. Create a Python script, `factorial.py`, with your assignment's requirements. Here is an example where a factorial of a number has to be calculated:

```python
def factorial(n):
    return 1 if (n==1 or n==0) else n * factorial(n - 1);
num = 5
print("Factorial of",num,"is",
factorial(num))
```

The above python script calculates the factorial of a number (for instance, here it is 5).

3. Next, make `vpl_execution` executable by running the command:

```bash
chmod +x vpl_execution
```
Now your `vpl_execution` file is executable.

4. Finally, TEST the environment on the VPL platform by clicking on `Check` in the VPL Activity.

It will run the `vpl_execution` file in a Docker image, and display the results for you in a safe secured environment. 

Command to run: Teacher or Student can test or submit their activity in the vpl module in Moodle by clicking on the `Test` or `Submit` buttons respectively.
