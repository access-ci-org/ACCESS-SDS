Use Case: Secure shell (SSH) is a program to log into another computer over a network, to execute commands in a remote machine, and to move files from one machine to another. It provides strong password authentication and secure encrypted data communications between two computers connecting over an insecure network such as the internet. OpenSSH is a freely available version of the Secure Shell (SSH).

Code details and examples: 

Code:
```
ssh -l username host
```
In the command above, `username` is your username on the remote system and `host` is the name of the remote system.

Use Case: Secure copy (SCP) is a means of securely transferring computer files between a local and a remote host or between two remote hosts.

Code details and examples: 

Code:
```
scp your_username@remotehost.edu:foobar.txt /local/dir
```
In the command above, `your_username` is your username on the remote system, `remotehost.edu` is the name of the remote system, `foobar.txt` is the name of the file you wish to copy, and `/local/dir` is the directory to which you want to copy the file. You will be asked for the password for your account on the remote host.
