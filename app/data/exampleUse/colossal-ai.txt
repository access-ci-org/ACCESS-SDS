Use Case: Use Colossal-AI for large scale deep learning tasks;

Code details and examples: Code 

With `colossalai`, you can define a deep learning model and perform training and inference on multiple GPUs in a distributed fashion. Here is an example of defining and training a simple model:

```python
# Import necessary libraries
import torch
import colossalai
from colossalai.context import Config
from colossalai.core import optimizer
from colossalai.engine import Engine
from torch.nn.parallel.distributed import DistributedDataParallel as DDP

# Define your model
class SimpleModel(torch.nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.linear = torch.nn.Linear(10, 10)

    def forward(self, x):
        return self.linear(x)

# Initialize colossal
config = Config('path_to_config_file')
engine = Engine(config)

# Define data
x = torch.ones(10).cuda()
y = torch.ones(10).cuda()

# Make model
model = SimpleModel().cuda()
model = DDP(model)

# Define loss and optimizer
loss_func = torch.nn.MSELoss()
optimizer = optimizer.Optimizer(model.parameters(), torch.optim.SGD, lr=0.01)

# Train model
for _ in range(1000):
    output = model(x)
    loss = loss_func(output, y)
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()
    optimizer.zero_grad()
```

To run the script, use the following command: `python script.py`.

The configuration file ('path_to_config_file') is used to set up your distributed environment, and it might look like this:

```yaml
train:
  data_parallel_size: 8
  tensor_parallel_size: 4
  pipeline_parallel_size: 2
  optimizer: adam
  grads_to_accumulate: 2
  micro_batch_size: 4
  auto_lr_scaling: linear
...
```

This file specifies options such as the number of GPUs for model/data/pipeline parallelism (data_parallel_size, tensor_parallel_size, pipeline_parallel_size), the optimizer to use, the number of gradients to accumulate before performing an update (grads_to_accumulate), and so on. This file should be tailored to your specific environment and training task.
