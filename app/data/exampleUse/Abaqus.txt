Use Case: Abaqus is used for finite element analysis and computer-aided engineering. Itâ€™s a software suited for general purpose analyses as well as advanced problems, such as those involving nonlinear behavior and large transformations. 

Code Details and Examples:

Code:

Step 1: Create an Input File for Abaqus.

Typically, Abaqus input files follow a.INP filename extension. A simple format of an input file containing two nodes and one element might look like following:

```
** NODE
*NODENode number, Degrees of freedom, X coordinate, Y coordinate
1, 0, 0,
2, 10, 10
** ELEMENTS
*ELEMENT, TYPE=B21, ELSET=BEAM
1, 1, 2
```

Step 2: Running Abaqus

To run Abaqus using the created input file, execute the following command in the terminal, where 'inputfile' is replaced with the name of your file:

```
abaqus job=inputfile
```

Please do not provide the ".inp" extension when specifying the job name. For example, if your input file is "beam.inp", you should run:

```
abaqus job=beam
```

Remember that both these steps need to be followed in the same directory where you have your Abaqus input files. Furthermore, for a detailed usage of Abaqus and its different modules, users are suggested to refer to its software documentation.
