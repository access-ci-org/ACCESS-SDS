Use Case: Kaiju is a bioinformatics software used for taxonomic classification of sequences from metagenomic reads against a reference database containing taxa-specific marker genes. For example, it might be used to determine the species composition of bacteria in a given environmental sample.

Code details and examples: Code 

Input File: Kaiju requires a file of metagenomic reads in FASTA or FASTQ format. An example read might be:

    >read1
    ACGTACGTACGTACGT
    >read2
    GTCAGTCACTGACG
    ...

Database: Kaiju uses a database of reference protein sequences. While several pre-made databases are available from the Kaiju website, users can also build their own using the 'kaiju-makedb' command.

Command: To run Kaiju on an input file named 'reads.fq' against a database 'proteins.fmi', the command would be:

    kaiju -t /path/to/proteins.fmi -i /path/to/reads.fq -o kaiju.out

Output: The output of this command is a file 'kaiju.out' that contains the classification results, where each line corresponds to a read in the input file. The output file is tab-delimited and has the following columns: 

    1. "C" or "U": whether the read was classified or unclassified.
    2. Name of the read.
    3. Taxon identifier of the assigned taxon.
    4. Name of assigned taxon.
    5. Matched fragment of the read sequence (optional).
    6. Name of the reference sequence that was used for classification (optional).

Example of an output line might be:

    C       read1   1234    Bacteria        ACGTACGT
        
This would indicate that read1 was classified (C) into taxon 1234 (Bacteria) based on the sequence fragment ACGTACGT.
