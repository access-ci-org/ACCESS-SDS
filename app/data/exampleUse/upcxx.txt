Use Case: UPcxx is used for data parallel programming and supports executing code in parallel and managing data locality.

Code:

UPC++ is a C++ library that supports the Partitioned Global Address Space (PGAS) model. Here's how to write a simple "Hello, World!" program in UPC++.

```cpp
#include <upcxx/upcxx.hpp>
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    upcxx::init();
    std::cout << "Hello, world! I am " << upcxx::rank_me() << " of " << upcxx::rank_n() << ".\n";
    upcxx::finalize();
    return 0;
}
```

In the code above, `upcxx::init()` and `upcxx::finalize()` are used to initialize and clean up UPC++, respectively. `upcxx::rank_me()` returns the rank (ID) of the current process from 0 to `upcxx::rank_n()-1`.

To compile and run the program, save it in a file named `hello.cpp`, and then:

```
$ upcxx -o hello hello.cpp
$ upcxx-run -n 4 ./hello

You should see something like:

Hello, world! I am 0 of 4.
Hello, world! I am 1 of 4.
Hello, world! I am 2 of 4.
Hello, world! I am 3 of 4.
```

The `-n 4` option specifies the number of processes to run.
