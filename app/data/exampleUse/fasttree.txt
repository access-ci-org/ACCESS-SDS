Use Case: FastTree is a tool for inferring phylogenies or evolutionary trees. The input file is usually in fasta format and contains a multiple sequence alignment. 

Code Details and Examples:

Code:

Typically, data is piped into FastTree using UNIX pipe operator (|). The example below shows how an alignment file in fasta format, "aligned.fasta", is piped into FastTree to construct a maximum likelihood tree, which FastTree then prints to standard output.

Command:
```
cat aligned.fasta | FastTree > tree.newick
```

This command reads a MSA (Multiple Sequence Alignment) from "aligned.fasta", calculates a phylogenetic tree using FastTree, and then output the tree structure in Newick format to a file named "tree.newick". Note that FastTree only supports sequential fasta format (with no line breaks within a sequence.)

In the input file "aligned.fasta", each line should begin, in order, with:

- A '>', indicating the beginning of a new sequence
- The sequence ID
- The sequence itself. 

Example of input file:
```
>seq1
AGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAG
>seq2
AGCTAGCTTGCTAGCTTG
>seq3
CGCTAGCTGGCTAGCTGG
```

Sequence IDs must be unique and can contain any printable ASCII character except for newline and '>'.

The resulting "tree.newick" file will contain a phylogenetic tree in Newick format describing the evolutionary relationships between the input sequences.
