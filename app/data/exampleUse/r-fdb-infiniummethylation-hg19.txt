Use Case: Use r-fdb-infiniummethylation-hg19 for analyzing DNA methylation data to understand gene expression, cellular differentiation, or health and disease states. It provides a platform for users to access well-documented Infinium Methylation data. The methylation data to be analyzed should be in CSV format with the first column as the identifier and subsequent columns as data values. A necessary input file is a text file with hg19 annotations.

Code details and examples: Code
```r
# Loading the library
library(rFDb.InfiniumMethylation.hg19)

# Creating the ff object for large data
ff_path <- "/path/to/your/input_file.csv"
data <- read.csv.ffdf(file = ff_path, FUN = "read.csv")

# Creating manifest object from Infinium annotation based on your data file
anno <- FDb.InfiniumMethylation.hg19()

# You can query the manifest object for particular regions using select() function
regions_with_data <- select(anno, 
                            keys = data$probe_id, 
                            columns = c("UCSC_CpG_Islands_Name", 
                                        "UCSC_RefGene_Name", 
                                        "UCSC_RefGene_Group"), 
                            keytype = "Name")

# Now you can merge your data with the regions using your preferred function,
# and then perform a variety of analyses on the data.
```
Command to run:
You run the above script using Rscript or inside an R environment.
```r
Rscript /path/to/your/code.R
```
Please replace "/path/to/your/input_file.csv" and "/path/to/your/code.R" with the path to your input file and your R script, respectively.
