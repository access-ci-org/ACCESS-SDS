Use Case: Use NWCHEM for computational chemistry. 

Code details and examples: Code

Sample Input File: 

```
start h2o
geometry
  O     
  H 1 R
  H 1 R 2 A
end
basis
  *
  library 6-31G
end
SCF
end
task SCF optimize
```
In the input file, the line `start h2o` starts a new job called "h2o". The `geometry` block defines the molecular structure. The `basis` block specifies the basis set. The `task scf optimize` command tells NWCHEM to perform an SCF (Hartree-Fock) optimization of the molecular geometry. The variables R and A are two parameters you can play with. They decide the distance between hydrogen and oxygen atoms (R) and the angle between them (A).

To execute an NWCHEM calculation, prepare an appropriate input file (the above is an example), then run the following command in the directory where the input file resides:

```nwchem input.nw > output.out```
