Use Case: Meson is used as a build system designed to be user friendly and to optimize programmer productivity. It is suitable for large scale software projects and is language agnostic, making it an ideal tool for compiling source codes from different programming languages.

Code details and examples:

Your project's source files are separated into directories. For instance:
```
src/
    hello.cpp
    greeter.cpp
    greeter.h
```

Sample meson.build file:

```
project('hellogreet', 'cpp',
  version : '0.1',
  default_options : ['warning_level=3'])

executable('hello',
  'src/hello.cpp',
  'src/greeter.cpp',
  cpp_args : '-DHELLO_MESSAGE="Hello, Meson!"',
)
```

Command to run:
```
meson setup build
ninja -C build
./build/hello
``` 

The file 'meson.build' is required at the root of your project. The first line begins with the word project, giving it a name and specifying the programming languages it will use. The executable function creates an executable with the specified source files. You can provide additional arguments as needed. The `meson setup build` is a command line command to setup the build folder. The `ninja -C build` command compiles the project and `./build/hello` runs the executable file.
