Use Case: XtalOpt is an evolutionary algorithm for crystal structure prediction. It is utilised for predicting stable crystal structures and studying the phase diagrams of materials. XtalOpt is integrated into the Avogadro molecular editor enabling a nice graphical interface.

Sample Input (XtalOpt Parameter File):

```
# Required Inputs
scellA1 = 0 0.5 0.5
scellA2 = 0.5 0 0.5
scellA3 = 0.5 0.5 0
scellVol = 100
pmVol = 50
minVol = 50
maxVol = 200
percentRandomInits = 25
numInitial = 10
optimizationType = 0

# GA Parameters
limitDist = -1
runningJobLimit = 25
tol_spg = 0.1
uphillMaxFailures = 20
reMagSteps = 20

# Similarity Thresholds
tol_spg = 0.3
tol_spg_dup = 0.1
tol_spg_dup_formation = 5.5

```

Command to run it:

```
xtalopt [options] <xtaloptrc>
```

Please ensure that the sample input file and the command to run the software are according to the XtalOpt documentation guidelines. This example if for the most basics setup, XtalOpt allows for much more complex scenarios.
