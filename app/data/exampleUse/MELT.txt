Use Case: MELT (Mobile Element Locator Tool) is a software that is used for discovering, annotating and genotyping Transposable Elements (TE) in high-throughput sequencing data. It can be used to study genetic variation caused by TE insertions in a population.

Code details and examples: 

The configuration and command line specification to run MELT-SPLIT and MELT-DELETION are given below.

MELT-SPLIT

INPUT format required: BAM file (for the samples) and a VCF file (for the reference).

Specifications and details in input files: the input files must be sorted and must have a corresponding index file in the same directory.

Command to run:

`java -Xmx2G -jar MELT.jar Split -w <working directory> -t <transposons.bed> -c <ME_sequence_file.fasta> -h <reference_genome_file.fasta> -n <sample_file.bam>`

MELT-DELETION

Input format required: BAM files (for the samples) and a VCF file (for the reference).

Specifications and details in input files: The input files must be sorted and must have a corresponding index file in the same directory.

Command to run:

`java -Xmx2G -jar MELT.jar Deletion -w <working directory> -l <indel_file.vcf> -h <reference_genome_file.fasta> -n <sample_file.bam>`

Note: Replace `<...>` with your own values.

Please be sure to include the full path to your files if they are not in your working directory. The `-Xmx2G` specifies the maximum memory allocation pool for a Java Virtual Machine (JVM), in this case, 2GB. Please adjust this according to the specification and requirements of your system and task. The `-jar MELT.jar` indicates that MELT is run from a compiled jar file.
