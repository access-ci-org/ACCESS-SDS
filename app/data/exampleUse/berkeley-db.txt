Use Case: Use Berkeley DB for data persistence. It introduces fast, scalable, transactional database support to applications.

Code details and examples: Code

Berkeley DB is primarily a C library, though it has APIs for C++, Java, Perl, Python and others. Here is a simple example in Python:

```python
import bsddb3

# open the database
db = bsddb3.btopen('test.db', 'c')

# insert a record
db['key'] = 'value'

# retrieve a record
print(db['key'])

# and close the database
db.close()
```

In this simple Python example, we use BerkeleyDB to store a key-value pair and then retrieve it. The `bsddb3.btopen('test.db', 'c')` opens the database, creating it if it does not exist ('c' option). The `db['key'] = 'value'` stores the key-value pair and `print(db['key'])` fetches and prints the value associated with 'key'. Finally, `db.close()` closes the database.

Since Berkeley DB is a library, rather than a standalone server, it's embedded directly into your application, so there's no separate server process to run/stop/etc. As a database library, Berkeley DB provides cursors, transactions, replication, and other features normally found in a complete database server. 

So, there's no specific "command to run" the software. Rather, you'll run whatever application you write that uses the library.
