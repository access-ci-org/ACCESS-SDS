Use Case: bali-phy is used for simulating and estimating evolutionary biology processes. It can be used for alignment and phylogeny estimation from molecular sequence data with an accounting for uncertainty.

Code details and examples: Code

bali-phy accepts an input file in NEXUS format. 

The NEXUS file has things like `#NEXUS`, `Begin data;` and `End;`.
Here is an example of a part of a NEXUS file:

```
#NEXUS
Begin data;
Dimensions ntax=3 nchar=13;
Format datatype=dna gap=- matchchar=. ;
Matrix
taxon1   AAGCTTCACCGTG
taxon2   AAGCTTCACCGTG
taxon3   AAGCTTCACCGTG
End;
```

This defines a small sequence alignment with three taxa (taxon1, taxon2, taxon3) and 13 characters long. 

The command to invoke bali-phy to analyze a nexus file named "sequences.nex" would be:
```
bali-phy sequences.nex
```
