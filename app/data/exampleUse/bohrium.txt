Use Case: Bohrium is a framework for automatic array-level parallelization in high-level computer programming languages like Python. It is utilized for conducting large scale computations with massive data arrays without the need for hand-coded parallelization. 

Code details and examples:

Code:

Sample python code showing the use of bohrium to perform some computations on arrays.

```python
import numpy as np
import bohrium as bh

# Creating array with bh.array() instead of np.array()
A = bh.array([1, 2, 3, 4])
B = bh.array([5, 6, 7, 8])

# Perform computation between two arrays
C = A + B

bh.flush()
print(C)
```

In the code above, bh.array() is used to create arrays A and B. The + operation is then used to perform element-wise addition of A and B. The result is stored in C. Finally, bh.flush() is called between computations, this will force Bohrium to execute any computation that might be delayed thereby yielding the final result which is then printed.

Command to run:

The python script file can be saved as filename.py (for example bohrium_demo.py) and the script can be run using the following command.

```bash
python bohrium_demo.py
```

The above command will output the result of the element-wise addition operation performed on arrays A and B.
