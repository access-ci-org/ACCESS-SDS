Use Case: Xclock is a simple and lightweight clock for X that can be run in analog or digital mode. It is used to check the current time, a simple demonstration of an X client, or testing system performance.

Code details and examples: Code

The xclock program does not require any input files. It uses command line options to customize the appearance and behavior. Here are some of the options:

- "-analog": display analog clock
- "-digital": display digital clock
- "-padding number": specify the amount of space between the text and the windowâ€™s borders
- "-update seconds": specify how frequently the clock should be updated

A sample command to run xclock could be:

```bash
xclock -digital -padding 10 -update 1
```

This command will run xclock in digital mode, with a padding of 10 pixels around the text, and an update interval of 1 second. 

To run the software, you just need to type the command into your terminal (assuming you have xclock installed and in your system's PATH).
