Use Case: Use kover for genome-wide association studies on microbial genomics. Kover aims at linking genotypic and phenotypic variability allowing for a comprehensive genome-wide association study.

Code details and examples: Code.

1. kover dataset create from-sequence

This command will create a new dataset using the provided sequence information.

Command: `kover dataset create from-sequence --genomic-data genome_data.fasta --phenotype-description "The phenotype of interest" --phenotype-metadata metadata.tsv --output dataset.kover`

Here, genome_data.fasta is a multi-FASTA file where each entry represents a subject's genome and metadata.tsv is a tab-delimited file where each line represents a subject and contains 2 columns: the FASTA identifier and the phenotype.

2. kover learn

This command will use machine learning algorithms to discover genomic regions that are associated with the phenotype of interest.

Command: `kover learn --dataset dataset.kover --model-type cart --p-bound 1 --model-risk 0.1 --output model.km`

3. kover predict

This command will predict the phenotype of unseen data using a learned model.

Command: `kover predict --dataset dataset.kover --model model.km --genomic-data unknown_genomes.fasta --output predictions.tsv`

Here, unknown_genomes.fasta is a multi-FASTA file where each entry represents a subject's genome for which the phenotype is unknown. The predicted phenotype will be written to predictions.tsv.
