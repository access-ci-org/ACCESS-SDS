Use Case: oneTBB is a flexible C++ library that simplifies the work of adding parallel computing tasks to software. It provides a rich and complete approach to expressing parallelism thanks to its task-based algorithms, concurrent containers and task scheduler.

Code Details and Examples:

Code:
```
#include "tbb/parallel_for.h"
#include "tbb/blocked_range.h"
#include <vector>

class ApplyFoo {
  std::vector<int>& my_vector;
public:
  void operator()( const tbb::blocked_range<size_t>& r ) const {
    for( size_t i=r.begin(); i!=r.end(); ++i )
      my_vector[i] = foo(my_vector[i]);
  }
  ApplyFoo(std::vector<int>& v ) :
    my_vector(v)
    {}
};

void ParallelApplyFoo( std::vector<int>& a ) {
  tbb::parallel_for(tbb::blocked_range<size_t>(0,a.size()),
                    ApplyFoo(a));
}
```

Explanation:

The above example shows how to use oneTBB's `parallel_for` to concurrently apply a function `foo` to all elements in a `std::vector`, where `foo` is a user-defined function. 

The `ApplyFoo` class encapsulates the action of applying `foo` to an element. Its operator() applies `foo` to a range of elements. The `ParallelApplyFoo` function splits the total range [0,a.size()) into subranges and applies `ApplyFoo` to each subrange.

- Input file: Not applicable. This code operates on a `std::vector` in memory. You need to define the `foo` function and the `std::vector`.
- Format Required: The standard format of a C++ source file (.cpp).
- Specifications and details in the input file: Not applicable for this use case.

- Command to run the code: After installing oneTBB and setting it up correctly, you can compile and run the program as you would with any C++ code. For example, with g++:

```
$ g++ -I /path/to/tbb/include -L /path/to/tbb/lib -ltbb your_file.cpp
$ ./a.out
```
