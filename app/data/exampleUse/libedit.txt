Use Case: libedit is a software library that provides functions to support line editing. These functions include those used to read a line from the terminal, set command history, and perform tab completion. Ideal for command-line interfaces and scripting languages, providing user-friendly interfaces to utilities or services that require command-line inputs.

Code details and examples:

Code:
```C
#include <stdio.h>
#include <histedit.h>

char *prompt(EditLine *e);

char *prompt(EditLine *e) {
    return "prompt> ";
}

int main(void) {
    EditLine *el;
    History *myhistory;
    HistEvent ev;

    el = el_init("myprog", stdin, stdout, stderr);
    el_set(el, EL_PROMPT, &prompt);
    el_set(el, EL_EDITOR, "emacs");

    myhistory = history_init();
    if (myhistory == 0) {
        fprintf(stderr, "history could not be initialized\n");
        return 1;
    }

    history(myhistory, &ev, H_SETSIZE, 800);

    el_set(el, EL_HIST, history, myhistory);

    for (;;) {
        int count;
        const char *line = el_gets(el, &count);

        if (!line || count <=0) break;

        history(myhistory, &ev, H_ENTER, line);

        printf("You entered: %s", line);
        fflush(stdout);
    }

    history_end(myhistory);
    el_end(el);
    return 0;
}
```
To run the example, save it to a file named `example.c`, then compile it with the following command:
```bash
gcc -o example example.c -ledit
```
This will create an executable named `example` which can be run by typing:
```bash
./example
```
