Use Case: Minipolish is a software tool in bioinformatics which is used to improve the accuracy of assembly consensus sequences generated by long-read assembly programs. It uses the Miniasm format for initial assembly and racon-hax for consensus construction. An example use case might be to improve the accuracy of a DNA sequence assembly from long-read sequencing data, like microbial genome data from Oxford Nanopore sequencing.

Code details and examples:
Code:

The input file for Minipolish is a .gfa file (graphical fragment assembly) produced by Miniasm and a .paf file (pairwise mapping format). It also requires sequencing reads in .fasta or .fastq format. Here's an example:

Miniasm.gfa /path/to/data/input.gfa
Miniasm.paf /path/to/data/input.paf
SequencingReads.fasta /path/to/data/sequencing_reads.fasta

Command to run the program:

```bash
minipolish -t12 /path/to/data/input.gfa /path/to/data/input.paf /path/to/data/sequencing_reads.fasta > minipolish_output.gfa
```

Note: `-t12` is an example parameter, adjust according to the number of threads wanted for the computation.  The output `minipolish_output.gfa` is the minipolish improved consensus sequence of the genome.

Relevant part of input gfa file structure:

```bash
S 1 KN805988.1 len=46550
L 1 + 2 - overlap=25339
```

Relevant part of input paf file structure:

```bash
tig00000001 46550 + read1001 12000 0 12000 12000 0 cm:i:116
```

Input .fasta file structure:

```bash
>read1001
ACTGACTGACTGACTGACTGACTGACTGACTGACTGACTGACTGACTGACTG
```

Please refer to the file formats specifications and the official software source for more detailed information. The presented structures and commands are basic examples to get started.
