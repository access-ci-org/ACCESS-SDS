Use Case: Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model is a numerical weather prediction and atmospheric simulation system designed for both operational forecasting and atmospheric research. 

Code details and examples: 

WRF requires input fields such as atmospheric conditions, land surface characteristics, and sea surface conditions. These are typically sourced from other numerical weather prediction (NWP) models.

1. Running WRF requires the creation of input files using WPS:
    - geo_em.d01.nc, which describes the geophysical data of the model domain.
    - wrfbdy_d01, which describes the outer-most domain boundary conditions.
    - wrfinput_d01, which describes the initial conditions.

2. After setting up your namelists (namelist.input, namelist.wps) and MetGrid files, use the specific commands to run each step:   

   ```shell
   ./geogrid.exe
   ./ungrib.exe
   ./metgrid.exe
   ./real.exe
   ./wrf.exe
   ```
  
Note: The commands are used for the MPI version and require that your machine be set up to run MPI processes. Plus, WRF should have been configured and compiled to run on multiple processors - this is done before running the program and is part of the setup and installation of WRF, which is not covered in this response.

Code Snippet:

This is a sample `namelist.input` snippet for WRF:

```
 &time_control
 run_days                            = 0,
 run_hours                           = 12,
 run_minutes                         = 0,
 run_seconds                         = 0,
 start_year                          = 2001, 2001, 2001,
 start_month                         = 06,    06,    06,
 start_day                           = 25,    25,    25,
 start_hour                          = 12,    12,    12,
 start_minute                        = 00,    00,    00,
 start_second                        = 00,    00,    00,
 end_year                            = 2001, 2001, 2001,
 end_month                           = 06,    06,    06,
 end_day                             = 26,    26,    26,
 end_hour                            = 00,    00,    00,
 end_minute                          = 00,    00,    00,
 end_second                          = 00,    00,    00,
```

Output:
The main output from WRF is a NetCDF file named `wrfout_d01_2007-06-25_12:00:00` which can be visualized using NCAR Command Language (NCL), Python with libraries like netCDF4 or xarray, or any other tool that can process NetCDF files.
