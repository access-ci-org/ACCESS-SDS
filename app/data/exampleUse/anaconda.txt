Use Case: Anaconda is a free and open-source distribution of the Python and R programming languages for scientific computing (data science, machine learning applications, large-scale data processing, predictive analytics, etc.), that aims to simplify package management and deployment.

Code details and examples: Code

1. Scikit-learn (Machine Learning in Python, for python programming): Anaconda encapsulates scikit-learn which is a tool for data mining and data analysis. 

Python code to load data, fit a model and predict outputs: 

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

# Input:
X = np.array([[1, 1], [1, 2], [2, 2], [2, 3]])
# y = 1 * x_0 + 2 * x_1 + 3
y = np.dot(X, np.array([1, 2])) + 3

reg = LinearRegression().fit(X, y)

# Make predictions using the testing set
print('Predictions: \n', reg.predict(np.array([[3, 5]])))
```
Command to run:
```
python filename.py
```
In above example, `filename.py` is the name of the Python file where above code is saved.

2. NumPy (Python library used for numerical operations):

Python code to perform mathematical operations:

```python
import numpy as np

# Input
a = np.array([1, 2, 3])
b = np.array([4, 5, 6])

print("Addition: ", np.add(a, b))
print("Multiplication: ", np.multiply(a, b))
```
Command to run:
```
python filename.py
```
In above example, `filename.py` is the name of the Python file where above code is saved.

Note: In both examples, numerical data is used as it is compatible with the libraries and tools.
