Use Case: CellRank for Trajectory inference in Single-Cell Sequencing; it uses single-cell transcriptome data to map out cell developmental trajectories and their corresponding cells of origin, visualize these trajectories.

Code Details and Examples:

Code:

```python
import scvelo as scv
import cellrank as cr

# Your input data - an AnnData object.
adata = cr.datasets.pancreas()

# The main function of cellrank is `cellrank.tl.estimate_transition_matrix()`.
# Its parameters depend on the method chosen. 
# Ideally, the input data has been preprocessed adequately - e.g. only the relevant genes 
# (highly variable genes, feature genes specific to your biological application) should be included. 
# Missing genes can be computed via diffusion pseudotime or velocity-based extrapolation.

# compute RNA velocity
scv.pp.filter_and_normalize(adata)
scv.pp.moments(adata)
scv.tl.recover_dynamics(adata)
scv.tl.velocity(adata)
scv.tl.velocity_graph(adata)

# perform CellRank
cr.tl.estimate_transition_matrix(adata, method='stochastic')
cr.tl.terminal_states(adata)
cr.tl.initial_states(adata)
cr.tl.lineages(adata)
final_states = adata.obsm['to_terminal_states']
lineages = adata.obsm['to_lineages']

```
Running the script: This code can be run using a Python interpreter, such as the one in the Jupyter notebook or by saving the script in a .py file and running it from the terminal with `$ python filename.py`

Input Data: The `AnnData` objects are an efficient way of dealing with large, multi-dimensional data. The object contains various slots to store raw/normalized counts, PCA space, clustering results, and auxiliary data. Files can be in several formats, such as `H5AD`, `loom`, or some types of `mtx` files. 

Command to run: Not applicable as code snippets are run in an interactive python environment.
