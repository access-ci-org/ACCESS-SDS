Use case: RUSH is an integrated scripting language and shell for distributed systems management. It's frequently used in the fields of high-performance computing, computational science, and large-scale data processing. 

Code Details and Examples:

Code:

1. For a basic Hello World program:

```rush
echo("Hello, World!")
```

To run this code, save it into a file (for example, hello.rush), and then run RUSH interpreter to execute it:

```bash
rush hello.rush
```

2. For a parallel processing example, such as performing a distributed task across multiple machines:

```rush
# Define hosts
hosts = ["192.168.0.1", "192.168.0.2", "192.168.0.3"]

# Perform tasks in parallel on the defined hosts
parallel for host in hosts do
  remote run(host) do
    system("hostname") # Commands executed on the remote host
  end
end
```

In the above example, the system("hostname") command will be executed in parallel on each host specified in the 'hosts' array.

To run this code, save it as a RUSH script (for example, parallel.rush), and then run the RUSH interpreter to execute the script:

```bash
rush parallel.rush
```

Specifications:

Input files in RUSH are written in its specific scripting language and can incorporate multiple hosts and commands. There's no specific input file required as it works more about executing computational operations under a shell environment. Combinations of commands, loops, and conditionals can be written in RUSH scripts, according to what the user wish to accomplish. 

Note: IP addresses and server names used in this context are placeholders. In practice, use actual, valid IP addresses or server names. Server access permissions and SSH keys may be required for remote tasks, depending on the server's security configuration. 

RUSH does not directly work with input files in contrast to some software packages, but rather operates through its scripting environment. However, scripts themselves could be viewed as input files, as they dictate the tasks that RUSH will execute.
