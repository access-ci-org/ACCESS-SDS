Use Case: Talon software is employed for the detection of transcripts in long-read transcriptomic data. It is especially beneficial for annotating novel isoforms and identifying transcript diversity.

Code details and examples: Code

Input:

Talon requires two primary input files:

1. A GTF annotation file: This file summarizes the gene transcripts feature like start and end position on chromosome, coding/non-coding genes, exon number and their positions.

2. A SAM or BAM alignment file: These files contain the mapping of sequence reads from transcript data against a reference genome. 

An example of a GTF file is as follows:

```
chr1	ENSEMBL	gene	65419	71585	.	+	.	gene_id "ENSG00000282827.1_2"; gene_name "MIR6723"; gene_type "miRNA";
chr1	ENSEMBL	transcript	65419	71585	.	+	.	gene_id "ENSG00000282827.1_2"; transcript_id "ENST00000624652.1_1"; gene_name "MIR6723"; gene_type "miRNA"; transcript_name "MIR6723-201"; transcript_type "miRNA";
chr1	Esemblel	exon	65419	65433	.	+	.	gene_id "ENSG00000282827.1_2"; transcript_id "ENST00000624652.1_1"; exon_number "1"; gene_name "MIR6723"; gene_type "miRNA"; transcript_name "MIR6723-201"; transcript_type "miRNA";
```

An example of a SAM file is as follows:

```
ERR688524.100007104	0	1	10001	60	50M	*	0	0	CAGCCATCCTTCTTCCTCTTTTCACAAGGAATGAGAGGCACAGACTCAT	AAFFFJJJJJFJJJJJJAJFJJJFFFJJJFFJJJAFJ-AAAFJ<FJJJJ	AS:i:0	XS:i:0

```

Command to run:

Talon requires two steps to run: initialization of the genome and read dataset, followed by actual processing:

```
talon_initialize_genome --f <GTF file> --g <genome name> --a <annotation name>
talon --f <alignment file> --db <database file> --build <genome build>  --o <output prefix>
```

Where, 
- "<GTF file>" is the path to your input GTF file,
- "<genome name>" is the name you want to assign to this genome build,
- "<annotation name>" is the name you want to assign to this annotation build,
- "<alignment file>" is the path to your input SAM/BAM file,
- "<database file>" is the path to the TALON database created during initialization,
- "<genome build>" is the name of your genome build as specified during the initialization,
- "<output prefix>" is the prefix you want to use for your output files.
