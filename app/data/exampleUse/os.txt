Use Case: Use os (a Python library) to read, write, and manipulate files and directories on the system.

Code details and examples: 

Here is an example of how to rename a file using os:

Code:

```python
import os

# specify the current path and file name
original_file = 'original_file.txt'

# specify the new file name
new_file = 'new_file.txt'

# rename the original file
os.rename(original_file, new_file)
```

To run this, you will need a file called 'original_file.txt' in the same directory where you run the script. 

Your input file should be in plain text format (txt). There are no specific requirements for content in the input file, it could be anything in plain text.

This command will rename the file 'original_file.txt' to 'new_file.txt'.

Another example is using os to get the list of files in a particular directory:

Code:

```python
import os

# specify the directory
directory = '/path/to/directory'

# use os to get list of files
files = os.listdir(directory)

# print the list of files
for file in files:
    print(file)
```

To run this, you need to specify the directory path. Your path should be the absolute path or the relative path from where you run the script.

This command will print a list of all files and directories in the specified directory.
