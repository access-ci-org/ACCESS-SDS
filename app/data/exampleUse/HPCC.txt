Use Case: HPCC (High-Performance Computing Cluster) is a comprehensive, open-source big-data computing platform. It allows large scale data processing and analytics. An example can be parsing through large amounts of data, like Log files, for specific formatting or pattern matching.

Code Details and Examples:

Input file: Assume we have a Log.txt file containing a large data set.

Python Code Snippet:
```python
from hpccm.templates.CMakeBuild import CMakeBuild

cm = CMakeBuild()

# The installation prefix
cm.prefix = '/usr/local'

# The source directory
cm.srcdir = '/path/to/source'

# Any extra arguments to pass to CMake
cm.extra_cmake_args = ['-DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON']

# Generate a CMake build stage
print(str(cm))
```

This Python code uses the HPCCm (HPC Container Maker) Python module to define a CMake build stage. The parameters defined include the installation prefix (the path where the built executables should be placed), the source directory (the path to the source code to build), and any additional arguments to pass to CMake. These additional arguments control CMake's behaviour beyond what's defined in the build script.

Command to Run: To run the above Python script, save it to a file called build.py, then run it in the terminal with the command:
```bash
python3 build.py
```

Specify the output format required by commenting at the top of your python file:
```python
# format: docker
```
To enable this format in code, the command is:
```bash
hpccm --recipe recipe.py --format docker
```

Note: You must have the HPCCm module installed to run this script, and the above Python script must be executed where docker is installed and containerized. The script also assumes you have the necessary rights and environment to execute python3 and docker commands.
