Use Case: Scalasca is a software tool that supports the performance optimization of parallel programs by measuring and analyzing their runtime behavior. The analysis identifies potential performance bottlenecks – in particular those concerning communication and synchronization – and offers guidance in exploring their causes.

Code details and examples: Code. 

While Scalasca does not directly need an input file, it uses an executable file generated from a source code with its libraries. For example, here we are analyzing an MPI program, `myprogram.c`:

```c
#include <mpi.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char** argv) {
    MPI_Init(NULL, NULL);

    int world_size;
    MPI_Comm_size(MPI_COMM_WORLD, &world_size);

    int world_rank;
    MPI_Comm_rank(MPI_COMM_WORLD, &world_rank);

    char processor_name[MPI_MAX_PROCESSOR_NAME];
    int name_len;
    MPI_Get_processor_name(processor_name, &name_len);

    printf("Hello world from processor %s, rank %d out of %d processors\n", processor_name, world_rank, world_size);

    MPI_Finalize();
}
```
This program is then compiled with the mpi compilers and scalasca libraries:

```bash
$ mpicc myprogram.c -o myprogram
```
The Scalasca trace analysis can be done in two steps:

Measure:

```bash
$ scan -o experiment_archive experiment_dir COMMAND arg1 arg2 ...
```

Examine:
```bash
$ square experiment_archive
```
In this case, `scan` is used to run and profile your program, while `square` is used to analyze the results. `myprogram` is your MPI executable file. `experiment_dir` and `experiment_archive` are directories where the results are stored.
