Use Case: The NVHPC (NVIDIA HPC SDK) is a comprehensive suite of compilers and libraries for developing high-performance computing applications. A use case might be to compile and run a simple Fortran program that calculates the Fibonacci sequence up to a given number.

Code Details and Examples: 

Code:

This is a simple Fortran program called `fibonacci.f90`:

```fortran
program fibonacci
implicit none
integer :: n, res
print *, 'Enter a positive integer:'
read *, n
res = fib(n)
print *, 'The', n, 'th Fibonacci number is:', res
end program fibonacci

function fib(n)
implicit none
integer, intent(in) :: n
integer :: fib 
if (n == 0) then
  fib = 0
else if (n == 1) then
  fib = 1
else
  fib = fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)
end if
return
end function fib
```

Command to compile and run:

First, compile the Fortran program with `nfort`:

```
nfort -o fibonacci fibonacci.f90
```

After successful compilation, an executable file `fibonacci` is created. This can be run with:

```
./fibonacci
``` 

The program will then ask for input (a positive integer), calculate the Fibonacci number in that position, and print it to standard output.
