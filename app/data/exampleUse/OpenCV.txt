Use Case: Use OpenCV for image processing operations such as reading an image, gray scaling it and displaying the image.

Code details and examples: Code

Sample Image: The input file must be an image file. For example, we'll use 'example.jpg'.

Specifications: The input image must be present in the directory from which the script is run, or the full path to the file must be given.

Code:
"""
import cv2

# load color image 
img_color = cv2.imread('example.jpg')

# convert color image to grayscale
img_gray = cv2.cvtColor(img_color, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)

# Display the two images
cv2.imshow('Color image', img_color)
cv2.imshow('Grayscale image', img_gray)

# Need to press any key to close the image windows
cv2.waitKey(0)
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
"""

To run this code a python environment that is installed with OpenCV is necessary. Then use the command : python filename.py or python3 filename.py depending on your python installation to run the script.
