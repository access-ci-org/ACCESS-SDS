Use Case: librs is a library for reading and writing data in the RecordStream format, a computer-readable format for structured data. It's commonly used to manipulate data on the command-line or from shell scripts. 

Code details and examples: 

Code:
In this example, we will create a rs file from json and write the content of a rs file to a json file.

```python
import librs

# Create a recordstream object
rs = librs.RecordStream()

# Append some records
rs.append({"name": "John", "age": 18})
rs.append({"name": "Jim", "age": 20})

# Save to a file
with open("data.rs", "wb") as f:
    rs.write_to_file(f)

# Load file from a recordstream
with open("data.rs", "rb") as f:
    new_rs = librs.RecordStream.read_from_file(f)

# Write each record into json
for record in new_rs:
    print(json.dumps(record))

```

Command to run:

```bash
python3 script.py
```

input files: script.py
format required: Python script
Specifications in input files: No special requirements, other than that input data must be in the format expected by the RecordStream class (i.e., each record should be a Python dictionary). Please note that it is a hypothetical use-case. This library doesn't actually exist.
