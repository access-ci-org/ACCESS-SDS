Use Case: Use gconf to manage configuration data for GNOME applications potentially including command-line tool configuration.

Code details and examples: Code.

GConf is used to store configuration data in human-readable files. This script reads a particular key from the configuration database.

```python
import gconf
client = gconf.client_get_default()
value = client.get_string("/apps/metacity/global_keybindings/run_command_terminal")
print(value)
```

Command to run the code:

```bash
python3 script.py
```

The output will print the value of the specified key if it exists in the database.

Input Files: Not applicable.

Input Format: Plain text (any valid python code).

Specifications in Input File: The file should contain valid Python code. The key to be read ("run_command_terminal" in this example) should be changed to the specific key you wish to check. 

Note: gconf has been deprecated and succeeded by the dconf system, however if you are working with legacy systems or software it can still be used.
