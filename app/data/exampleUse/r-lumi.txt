Use Case: Use R-lumi for microarray data analysis. The R-lumi package is ideal for handling and analyzing Illumina microarray data. Here is an example of using R-lumi for reading data and preprocessing.

Code details and examples: Code.

Sample Input Files: The minimum requirement is a microarray file in a simple text format. Here is the structure:

    ID_REF    VALUE
    204567_x_at    7.26
    204968_s_at    7.35
    204846_s_at    7.23

To start, load the lumi package. The script below is given assuming that we are using R:

```R
library(lumi)
```

Next, read in the Illumina BeadStudio report file:

```R
yourData <- lumiR('yourFileName.txt')
```

Once your data has been read in, there are numerous preprocessing methods available. Below is an example of transforming the data using variance stabilizing transformation (VST):

```R
yourData.vst <- vst(yourData)
```

Here is how to perform robust spline normalization (RSN):

```R
yourData.rsn <- rsn(yourData.vst)
```

And finally, write your normalized data to an output file:

```R
write.exprs(yourData.rsn, file = "yourOutputFileName.txt")
```
  
Remember to replace 'yourFileName.txt' and 'yourOutputFileName.txt' with your actual input and output file names respectively.
