Use Case: QuantumEspresso is a powerful suite of software for performing analysis and predictions in quantum mechanics, primarily for material sciences and solid-state physics. It is used to simulate the electronic structure of materials using density functional theory (DFT), non-equilibrium Green's functions (NEGF), and many other advanced techniques.

Code details and examples: Code

The input file for QuantumEspresso's pw.x executable (performing DFT calculations) could look as such:

```
&CONTROL
 calculation = 'scf'
 prefix = 'platinum'
 pseudo_dir = './'
 outdir = './'
/
&SYSTEM
 ibrav = 2
 celldm(1) = 7.44
 nat = 1
 ntyp = 1
 ecutwfc = 30.0
/
&ELECTRONS
 diagonalization = 'david'
 mixing_beta = 0.7
/
ATOMIC_SPECIES
 Pt  195.08  Pt.pz-d-rrkjus.UPF
ATOMIC_POSITIONS (alat)
 Pt 0.0 0.0 0.0
K_POINTS (automatic)
 10 10 10 1 1 1
```
Above codes nanoparticle's platinum molecular structure. `ATOMIC_POSITIONS` specify where each atom is located. `K_POINTS` is for setting the k-point grid for Brillouin Zone sampling.

To run the input file `platinum.in` using QuantumEspresso package `pw.x`:

```bash
pw.x < platinum.in > platinum.out
```

It reads the input from `platinum.in`, executes the calculations and outputs the results to `platinum.out`. Note that `pw.x` needs to be in your system's PATH for command to work.
