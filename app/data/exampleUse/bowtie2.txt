Use Case: Bowtie2 is an ultrafast, memory-efficient tool for aligning sequencing reads to large genomes. It is widely used in bioinformatics for high-throughput sequence alignment in DNA sequencing. 

Code Details and Examples: 
Bowtie2 require plain text files that may be in single-end or paired-end format. 

Format Required: 
For example, paired-end reads could be in two .fasta/.q files:
- reads_1.fasta/reads_1.fq (sequence of the read (1st in pair))
- reads_2.fasta/reads_2.fq (sequence of the read (2nd in pair))

Input Specifications: 
- reads_1.fasta/reads_1.fq and reads_2.fasta/reads_2.fq files basically contain the sequences to be aligned. 

Code Sample: 

1. To build the index for the reference genome:

```
bowtie2-build /path/to/reference/genome.fasta genome
```

2. For performing paired end alignments:

```
bowtie2 -x /path/to/index/genome -1 reads_1.fq -2 reads_2.fq -S mapping_result.sam
```

3. For performing single end alignments:

```
bowtie2 -x /path/to/index/genome -U reads.fq -S mapping_result.sam
```

Where: 

- '/path/to/reference/genome.fasta' is the reference genome to which the reads will be aligned.
- 'genome' is the prefix for the index files.
- '-x' specifies the prefix of the index for the reference genome.
- '-1' and '-2' specify the input file(s).
- '-S' specifies the output file.
- 'reads_1.fq' and 'reads_2.fq' represent paired-end reads.
- 'reads.fq' represent single-end reads.
- 'mapping_result.sam' is the result of the alignment in SAM format.
