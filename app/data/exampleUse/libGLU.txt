Use Case: libGLU is a library written in C for making 3D graphics applications. Applications using libGLU would typically use it for 2D and 3D transformations, drawing geometric primitives, manipulating images and making animations.

Code details and examples: Code 

libGLU works by extending the functionality of OpenGL, an open source graphics library. A sample use case would be rendering a 3D object and making it rotate.

To use libGLU, you would need to include it in your C/C++ program like this:

```c
#include <GL/glu.h>
```

Here is a sample code snippet that uses the `gluLookAt` function, which sets up a view transformation, to create a simple 3D camera:

```c
#include <GL/glut.h>
#include <GL/glu.h>

float angle = 0.0;

void display() {
   glClear(GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT | GL_DEPTH_BUFFER_BIT);
   glLoadIdentity();
   gluLookAt (0.0, 0.0, 5.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0);
   glRotatef(angle, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0);
   glColor3f(1.0, 0.0, 0.0);
   glutSolidCube(1.0);
   glFlush();
   glutSwapBuffers();
}

int main(int argc, char** argv)
{
   glutInit(&argc, argv);
   glutInitDisplayMode(GLUT_SINGLE | GLUT_RGB);
   glutInitWindowSize(300, 300);
   glutInitWindowPosition(100, 100);
   glutCreateWindow("hello");
   glutDisplayFunc(display);
   glutMainLoop();
   return 0;
}
```

This program would create a window, set up a viewpoint, and then display a rotating red cube. You would compile this program with gcc and then run the resulting executable:

```
gcc -o hello hello.c -lGL -lGLU -lglut
./hello
```

Please note that you need to have the libGLU and GLUT libraries installed on your system to use them. Installation instructions were not requested, so they are not provided in this response.
