Use Case: MAFFT is a high-speed, high-accuracy multiple sequence alignment software for genomic data. Users can utilize this during the processing and analysis of genomic sequences.

Code details and examples: Code

Input File format:
Users need to provide an input file containing all the sequences that need to be aligned. This file should be in FASTA format. 

Here is an example of the input file format:
```
>sequence1
ATGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTG
>sequence2
ATGCGTAGTAGCTAGCTG
>sequence3
ATGCTAGCTAACAGCTG
```
Command:
To execute the MAFFT software, input a command with the following syntax:
```bash
mafft [options] filenames > outputfile
```
Here is a sample command to run MAFFT:
```bash
mafft --auto sequence.fasta > output.fasta
```
The `--auto` flag within the command allows best strategy option to be automatically chosen according to data size.

The output of the MAFFT command will be the multiple sequence alignment in FASTA format. You can then use this file for downstream analysis. 

Note: The ">" symbol is used for redirecting the output to a file. The output of your command will now be saved in a file named "output.fasta".
