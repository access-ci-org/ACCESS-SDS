Use Case: Use VADR (Viral Annotation DefineR) for annotating consistency checks of a fasta input file against a built-in viral reference model. 

Code details and examples:

Code to run vadr:
```
v-annotate.pl --informat fasta seqs.fa
```
Sample input file (`seqs.fa`):
```fasta
>seq1
MENSDTDYKLLACVFCGSVIGFQGNAEKFKEAFRLFARFLVAAFAFNAVFSSSIENVIEN
>seq2
LIGFAGNAQKEFGGAFLTAAFMYIAFAANIGMILLPKLHAADIKFFTSTFTVLGSVIGQL
```

Format in input file:
A simple text file in FASTA format where each sequence starts with a '>' line which includes the sequence identifier, followed by the sequence in the next lines. VADR does not accept multi-line sequences, each sequence should be in a single line. VADR can handle both DNA and protein sequences.

Specifications in input files:
The input fasta file for VADR should not contain any unrecognized characters. Only the following -

For nucleotide sequences: ACGTUacgtu
For protein sequences: ACDEFGHIKLMNPQRSTVWYacdefghiklmnpqrstvwy

VADR ignores all other characters including gaps, spaces, numbers in the sequences, and the sequences after the '#' character in a line.
