Use Case: The AlignStats software is used for inspecting and summarizing alignment statistics from next-generation sequencing data. It reads IDAT alignment files and generates statistics and plots for QC or exploratory data analysis. AlignStats can be used with a variety of input files including SAM, BAM, and FASTQ files.

Code details and examples:

Input file:

The input to AlignStats is typically a mapped sequence alignment file in BAM format:

```
@SQ SN:chr1 LN:248956422
@SQ SN:chr2 LN:242193529
@SQ SN:chr3 LN:198295559
read1 0 chr1 100 0 76M * 0 0 AAAAAGGGGGCCCCCCCTTTTTTTTTTGGGGGGGGGGCCCCTTGTAAAAAAAAA NM:i:3
read2 0 chr2 200 0 76M * 0 0 AAAAAGGGGGCCCCCCCTTTTTTTTTTGGGGGGGGGGCCCCTTGTAAAAAAAAA NM:i:2
```
This BAM file contains two reads, each 76bp long, mapping to chromosomes 1 and 2, with respective NM (edit distance) tags of 3 and 2.

Command to run AlignStats:

To generate statistics and plots from the BAM file, you would use the following command:

```bash
AlignStats -i input.bam -o output
```
This will produce a detailed summary of the alignment statistics in the output file. It can also take additional parameters for customization. Detailed usage instructions can be found in AlignStats's documentation.
