Use Case: In r-kernsmooth package, you can conduct kernel smoothing and regression. It includes functions such as dpik, which computes the optimal bandwidth for density estimation with a Gaussian kernel, bkde, which computes binned kernel density estimates, and locpoly, which computes local polynomial regression estimates.

Code details and examples:

Code:

You'll need to input a vector of data that you wish to compute the kernel smoothing regression for.

```r
# Load the library
library(KernSmooth)

# Create a simple data vector
data_vector <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10)

# Apply dpik function to compute the bandwidth
bw <- dpik(data_vector)

# Use this bandwidth for the bkde function
density_estimate <- bkde(data_vector, bandwidth = bw)

# Plot the result
plot(density_estimate)
```

Command to run:

In order to run this, you simply need to source the script in R. If you saved it as "script.R", you would do:

```r
source("script.R")
```

In this case, the input file is not needed as data is directly given in the code. However, if data is saved in a file, it can be imported in R using appropriate read functions.

Note: It is advisable to run these scripts in an environment where necessary packages are installed and loaded. Not all libraries may be pre-installed on your machine, and you might need to install them using the install.packages("<library_name>") command. This example assumes that KernSmooth is already installed in your R environment.
