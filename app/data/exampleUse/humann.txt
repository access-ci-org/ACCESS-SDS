Use Case: HUMAnN is a bioinformatics software that quantifies presence/absence and abundance of microbial pathways in a community from metagenomic data or from other microbial community sequencing data.

Code details and examples: 

Code: 

Typically, the input format is a .fastq file for this tool. Here is a command to run HUMAnN:

```bash
humann -i input.fastq -o output_folder
```
This will take the .fastq file as input and output the results to the specified output folder. 

If 'input.fastq' is the sample input file, then this would be the command. The software will output a variety of files including gene families, pathways, and species abundance in tsv format.

The input.fastq file consists of your metagenomic data. This data includes DNA sequences from the sample you're studying. The FastQ format includes:
- A sequence identifier with details about the sequence
- The raw sequence
- An identifier that's simply a "+"
- Encoding of the quality of the sequence 

Sample Input: 

```
@SEQ_ID
AGTTCCGGTTGTTAGTTAGT
+
!''*((((***+))%%%++)(%%%%).
@SEQ_ID
AGTTCCGGTTGTTAGTTAGT
+
!''*((((***+))%%%++)(%%%%).
```
This snippet is a simplified example of what a FastQ file would look like. They can contain sequences from millions of organisms depending on the sample size.

For 'humann', the sequences would relate to microbiome data. The software will process the file and output the abundance and presence of various organisms and their molecular pathways.
