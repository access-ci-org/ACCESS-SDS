Use Case: KiwiSolver is a fast and efficient implementation of the Cassowary constraint solving algorithm in Python. One effective use could be in using constraints to layout UI elements

Code details and examples:

```python
from kiwisolver import Variable, Solver

# Create a new variable
x = Variable("x")

# Create a new solver
solver = Solver()

# Add a constraint for the value of `x`
solver.addConstraint((x == 50))

# Update the solver
solver.updateVariables()

print(x.value())
```

This code snippet defines a variable `x` with the constraint that it must be equal to `50`, adds this constraint to the solver, updates the variables of the solver, and then prints the value of `x`. No input files are required for this minimal example.

Command to run:

```shell
python kiwi_example.py
```

Where `kiwi_example.py` is the python file containing the above sample code.
