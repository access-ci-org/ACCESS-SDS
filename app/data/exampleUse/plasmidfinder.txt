Use Case: PlasmidFinder is used in bioinformatics to identify plasmids in total or partial sequenced isolates of bacteria.

Code details and examples:

Code:

```
plasmidfinder.py -i input.fa -o output_dir
```

- The `-i` option indicates the input file, which should be a FASTA file (.fa or .fasta format) containing the bacterial sequences
- The `-o` option indicates the directory where the output files should be saved 

The input file would contain a sequence of nucleotides and look something like this:

```
>sequence1
ATGCGAGTGTTGAAGTTCGGCGGTACATCAGTGGCAAATGCAGAACGTTTTCTGCGTGTTGCCGATATTCTGGAAAG
>sequence2
CCGGGCCAACGACAAGGCGACCACCGCCGCCGACAAAGTCCGGCCGATCAATGAGCGTCCGGTTAAGGACGCATCGC
..
..
```

Each sequence should start with a '>' followed by an identifier and then the sequence of nucleotides.

The command to run PlasmidFinder would be:

``` 
python plasmidfinder.py -i input.fasta -o output_dir
``` 

This command would initiate the PlasmidFinder program, using the provided input file and placing the output in the specified directory.
