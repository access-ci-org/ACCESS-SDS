Use Case: PySPOA is used for multiple sequence alignment based on partial order graphs. It is often used in bioinformatics for tasks like sequence assembly, sequence alignment, and detection of sequence variants.

Code details and examples: Code

SAMPLE INPUT FILE FORMAT: It is necessary to create FASTA or FASTQ files with sequence data for input. The script reads from STDIN and writes to STDOUT.

Example FASTA file (`sequences.fasta`):
```
>sequence1
ATCGATTGAGCTCTAGCG
>sequence2
ATCGTTTGAGCTCTAGCG
>sequence3
ATCGGTTGAGCTCTAGCG
```

Code:


```python
import spoa

# read the sequences from the fasta file
def read_fasta(file):
    with open(file) as f:
        sequences = f.read().split('>')[1:]
    sequences = [s.replace('\n', '')[s.find('\n')+1:] for s in sequences]
    return sequences

sequences = read_fasta('sequences.fasta')

alignment_engine = spoa.AlignmentEngine()
graph = spoa.POG()

# add the sequences to the graph
for sequence in sequences:
    graph.add_alignment(alignment_engine.align(sequence), sequence)

# perform the multiple sequence alignment
msa, _ = graph.msa()

print(msa)
```

Command to run the code:
```
python align_sequences.py
```

This Python script reads multiple sequences from a FASTA file, aligns them with PySPOA, and prints the resulting multiple sequence alignment. If successful, this will output a list of aligned sequences. The alignment is represented as strings where the same index in each string corresponds to the same position in the alignment.
