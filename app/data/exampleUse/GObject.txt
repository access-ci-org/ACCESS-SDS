Use Case: GObject is a library that provides a versatile object system including the tools to create, use, and manage objects and object types in the software. It's largely used in software projects to provide structure and common functionality. It's common to use it in GUI applications where you have different custom widgets interacting with each other.

The programming languages supported by GObject are C, Vala, and any language that has bindings for GObject including Python and JavaScript.

Code details and examples: Code. 

In GObject, objects are instances of a GObject type. A type usually corresponds to a class which is defined with the `G_DECLARE_DERIVABLE_TYPE` or `G_DECLARE_FINAL_TYPE` macros.

Below is an example of a GObject object in C:

```c
#include <glib-object.h>

#define MY_TYPE_OBJECT (my_object_get_type ())
G_DECLARE_FINAL_TYPE (MyObject, my_object, MY, OBJECT, GObject)

struct _MyObject {
  GObject parent_instance;
};

G_DEFINE_TYPE (MyObject, my_object, G_TYPE_OBJECT)

void
my_object_class_init (MyObjectClass *klass) {
  /* Do nothing */
}

void
my_object_init (MyObject *self) {
  /* Do nothing */
}

int main (void) {
  MyObject *my_object;

  my_object = g_object_new (MY_TYPE_OBJECT, NULL);
  
  g_object_unref (my_object);

  return 0;
}
```

The command to compile and run it would be:

```bash
gcc my_object.c $(pkg-config --cflags --libs gobject-2.0) -o my_object
./my_object
```

If you want to use GObject in Python you have to use the PyGObject library. Here is the same example in Python:

```python
from gi.repository import GObject

class MyObject(GObject.Object):
    pass

def main():
    my_obj = MyObject()
    
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Here no compile command is needed, you can simply run the Python file with:

```bash
python my_object.py
```
