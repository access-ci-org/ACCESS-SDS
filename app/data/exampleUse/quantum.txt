Use Case: The Quantum Bioinformatics software is a versatile platform used in genomic data analysis and sequence comparison. Data generated from this tool is crucial in biomedical research, pharmaceuticals, and diagnostics, among other related fields.

Code details and examples: Code.

Sample Input File:
An input file in Quantum Bioinformatics is a FastQ or FastA file containing genetic sequences for analysis.

FastQ sample:
```
@SEQ_ID
GATTTGGGGTTCAAAGCAGTATCGATCAAATAGTAAATCCATTTGTTCAACTCACAGTTT
+
!''*((((***+))%%%++)(%%%%).1***-+*''))**55CCF>>>>>>CCCCCCC65
```
FastA sample:
```
>SEQ_ID
GATTTGGGGTTCAAAGCAGTATCGATCAAATAGTAAATCCATTTGTTCAACTCACAGTTT
```
Running the software:

The command-line interface is used to run the Quantum Bioinformatics software. The exact command ultimately depends on the operating system and the specific iteration of the software being used. However, a general format of the command is:

```bash
QuantumBioinformatics -i /path/to/input.file -o /path/to/output.file
```
This command will process the input file (`input.file`) and generate an output file (`output.file`). The exact parameters required by the software may vary depending on the use and the version of the software.
