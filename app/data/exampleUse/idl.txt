Use Case: IDL (Interactive Data Language) is a high-level language used for data analysis and visualization. IDL is commonly used in sectors such as astronomy, geosciences, medical imaging and physics. An example use case is the visualization of a 2-Dimensional array data.

Code details and examples: 

Code:

```
; Define a 2-dimensional array data with the size of (100,100)
data = DIST(100)

; Set the color range with values between 0 and the maximum data value.
TVLCT, INDGEN(256)*!D.TABLE_SIZE/256, INDGEN(256)*!D.TABLE_SIZE/256, 0

; Display the array as an image.
TV, data

; Define the location of the data point to query.
x = 50
y = 50

; Query the data value at the specified location.
print, data[x,y]
```
Input: There isn't any input file required for this simple image visualization in IDL. The variable "data" is an array generated by IDL's DIST function, and the x and y variables marked the position of the pixel in the data.

Command to run: IDL scripts can be run directly from the terminal using the IDL command, followed by -e flag and the name of the script. If your script was named "script.pro", you could run it with

```
idl -e script.pro
```
