Use Case: Judy is a high-performance dynamic array library. It allows developers to work with very large data arrays with high efficiency, making it ideal for programs handling large amounts of data.

Code details and examples:Code

Consider we have an array named `my_array` that we would like to insert numbers and corresponding addresses.

First, include the necessary header file:

```c
#include <Judy.h>
```

Next, declare a Judy array:

```c
Pvoid_t my_array = (Pvoid_t) NULL;  // initializes a Judy array with no index.
```

Insert a value into the array:

```c
Word_t index = 123; // The index where the value will be stored.
Word_t value = 456; // The value to be stored.

PPvoid_t PValue = JudyHSIns(&my_array, &index, sizeof(Word_t), PJE0);
*PValue = (Pvoid_t) value;
```

And finally, to find a value in the array with index:

```c
PPvoid_t PValue = JudyHSGet(my_array, &index, sizeof(Word_t));
if (PValue == PJERR) exit(1); // exit if error occurs
printf("The value at index '%lu' is '%lu'", index, *(Word_t *)PValue);
```

The command to run this file is:

```shell
gcc main.c $(pkg-config --cflags --libs judy) -o main && ./main
```
This command uses `pkg-config` to fetch the compiler and linker flags necessary for Judy, then compiles and runs the program.
