Use Case: Use pyGenomeViz for genome visualization such as drawing graphics of genome structure and annotation.

Code details and examples: 

Code:

```python
# Import the module
from pyGenomeViz.pyGenomeViz import Gene, Genome

# Make a new genome
myGenome = Genome("myGenomeID")

# Add genes to the genome
myGene = Gene("myGeneID", start=10, end=20, strand=1)
myGenome.add_gene(myGene)

# Draw the genome
myGenome.draw()

```

Input file format: pyGenomeViz does not require any input file. The software is based on Python's matplotlib library, so you create and manipulate data within the Python program itself.

Specifications in input data: This example assumes you have genomic data describing the start, end, and strand of a gene. This data could be obtained from a variety of sources such as a database or a gene annotation file.

Command to run: You run this Python script (saved as a .py file) with `python your_python_script.py` in your command line. Please make sure you have Python and the libraries listed above installed.
