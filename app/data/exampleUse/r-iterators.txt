Use Case: Use `r-iterators` for iterating over R objects in a memory-efficient way. This is especially useful when working with large datasets that could potentially exceed the available memory.

Code details and examples:

Code:
```R
# load the iterators package
library(iterators)

# create a vector
x <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

# create an iterator from the vector
iter <- iter(x)

# use the nextElem function to iterate over the elements
while(hasNext(iter)) {
  print(nextElem(iter))
}
```
