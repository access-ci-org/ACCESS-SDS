Use Case: OpenMPI is often used in physics and engineering simulations. For example, let's consider a use case where parallel processing is required to solve large-scale fluid dynamics problems using the Navier-Stokes equations. 

Code details and examples: Code

Sample Input File:

The input file (let's call it 'navier_stokes.c') for this problem might include the necessary information and data for the program to calculate the solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations. The file will typically include a series of initialization statements, mathematical equations, loops, and output statements written in C programming language. The exact specifics and details of the input file will depend on the problem being solved.

To use OpenMPI to run this program, the code needs to be compiled using mpicc (the MPI compiler for C programs) first:

```
mpicc navier_stokes.c -o navier_stokes
```

Now, the code can be run using mpirun (or mpiexec) with the required number of processes:

```
mpirun -np 4 ./navier_stokes
```

Here, '-np 4' specifies the number of processes to be used.

Note: OpenMPI requires its own command to run the program. It won't run by the generic 'gcc' compiler command for C files. 'mpicc' and 'mpirun' are the commands provided by OpenMPI to handle this.
