Use Case: ClearCNV is used to detect CNV (copy number variation) from data generated by genetic testing tools such as DNA microarrays.

Code details and examples:

Code: 

Input data format required by ClearCNV consists of several text files:

1. Marker information file: This file should contain the marker names, their chromosomal position, and physical (bp) position. Each record on its own line and fields separated by whitespace.

    Sample format:
    ```
    MarkerName Chromosome PhysicalPosition
    rs12345 1 1234567
    rs67890 1 2345678
    ```

2. Genotype data file: The file with the genetic data to be analyzed. Each marker on its own line and fields separated by whitespace.

    Sample format:
    ```
    SampleName MarkerName Genotype
    Subject1 rs12345 AA
    Subject1 rs67890 AB
    ```

3. Control data file: A file containing healthy (control) genetic data. Formatted the same way as the genotype data file.

The exact command to invoke ClearCNV depends on the specific details of the experiment, but it might look something like this:

```clearCNV detect_CNV config.txt```

Where 'config.txt' is a configuration file containing the paths and parameters required for processing. A sample configuration file could look something like this:

```
markers = /path/to/markers.txt
genotypes = /path/to/genotypes.txt
controls = /path/to/controls.txt
output = /path/to/output.txt
window_size = 50000
p_value = 0.05
penalty_value = 25
```

Each parameter in the configuration file:

- markers: path to the marker information file.
- genotypes: path to the genotype data file.
- controls: path to the control data file.
- output: path where the output file will be written.
- window_size: size of the sliding window for scanning the data (in base pairs).
- p_value: p-value threshold for calling a CNV.
- penalty_value: parameter for controlling the flexibility of the CNV detection. Higher values result in less possible breakpoints.
