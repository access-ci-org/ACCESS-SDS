Use Case: Quantumwise's Atomistix Toolkit (ATK) is an advanced atomic-scale modeling software that allows users to study electronic properties at nanostructures. This includes calculating electrical transport properties, total energies, force and stress and more.

Code details and examples: Code

The input files for ATK come in the form of Python scripts that set up the calculation particulars. Here a simple example of an input file for calculating the electronic bandstructure of silicon:

```python
from ase.lattice.cubic import Diamond
from QuantumATK import *

# Setup the silicon crystal structure (diamond lattice)
silicon_configuration = BulkConfiguration(
  bravais_lattice=Diamond(5.43*Angstrom),
  elements=[Silicon],
  cartesian_coordinates=[[0, 0, 0]]*Angstrom
)

# Set up the calculator (TB09 functional)
calculator = LCAOCalculator(
  basis_set=[
    LCAOBasis.Silicon_DoubleZetaPolarized
  ],
  exchange_correlation=TB09LDA(),
  k_point_sampling=MonkhorstPackGrid(5,5,5),
  self_consistency={
    'iterations': 500
  }
)

# Attach the calculator
silicon_configuration.setCalculator(calculator)

# Calculate bandstructure
bs = calculateBandstructure(silicon_configuration, [[0,0,0], [0.5,0,0], [0.5,0.5,0.5], [0,0,0]])

# Save the results
nlsave('silicon_bandstructure.hdf5', bs)
```

To run the simulation, one would use

```bash
atkpython my_script.py
```

where `my_script.py` is the above script file. The results will be stored in the HDF5-formatted `silicon_bandstructure.hdf5` file which can be analyzed using different tools in the ATK software package.
