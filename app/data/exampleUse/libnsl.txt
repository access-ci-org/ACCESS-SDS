Use Case: libnsl (Network Services Library) is a system programming library under the GNU C Library (glibc) that provides network functionality and client/server communication facilities.

Code details and examples: Code

In libnsl, the network services library is involved when we use Remote Procedure Call (RPC) communication between distributed processes in a network. An example is to write a server program in C that adds two numbers.

```C
#include <rpc/rpc.h>
#include "add.h"

double *
add_1_svc(doublepair *argp, struct svc_req *rqstp)
{
    static double  result;

    result = argp->a + argp->b;
    return &result;
}
```

In this case, the file `add.h` is the header file generated by rpcgen tool, which is used to generate the client and server stubs for RPC programs.

A common way to create and run RPC programs through libnsl goes as follows:
- Write the protocol in an XDR language
- Use the rpcgen command to compile into source and header files
- Use these files to write a server and a client program, which calls and utilizes the librns library
- Running an RPC based C program can look like this

```bash
$ gcc server.c add_svc.c add_xdr.c -o server -lnsl
$ ./server
```
And similarly for the client.

Note: The `-lnsl` flag when compiling informs the GCC compiler to link against libnsl library.

Please note that libnsl is used for network programming and dealing with distributed systems specifying protocol, so the input files or data are more in terms of networking data, requests or responses, and not Singular input files. The `add.h` mentioned above is an autogenerated file which helps bridge the RPC between client and server.

As it deals with Application Programming Interface (API) based networking program, the input comes as requests sent to the server from clients via the network. The server program then processes these requests and gives back the response. The details, form and structure of these requests and responses depend entirely on the specific implemented networking protocol.
