Use Case: The HH-suite is a toolkit for protein sequence searching and alignment constructions. It includes programs for deriving a multiple sequence alignment (MSA) from sequence database searches, for making an HMM from an MSA, and for searching databases using a query HMM.

Code Details and Examples:

1. Production of Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA)
Input Format: .fasta
Command: `addss.pl query.a3m`

Code Snippet:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
hhblits -i query.fasta -d database -oa3m query.a3m -n 3
addss.pl query.a3m
```
This can be implemented in a bash script and run via a bash shell.

2. Making a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) from an MSA
Input Format: .a3m or .hhm
Command: `hhmake -i query.a3m -o query.hhm`

Code Snippet:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
hhmake -i query.a3m -o query.hhm
```

This command takes an MSA file from the previous command and saves it as an HMM.

3. Searching Databases with a Query HMM
Input Format: .hhm
Command: `hhsearch -i query.hhm -d database`

Code Snippet:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
hhsearch -i query.hhm -d database
```

Here, the program takes an HMM file and searches a database for similar models.

All codes are run in a bash shell. Make sure to replace 'query.fasta' with your input fasta sequence, 'query.a3m' with your output MSA file, 'query.hhm' with your output HMM file, and 'database' with the database against which you are searching.
