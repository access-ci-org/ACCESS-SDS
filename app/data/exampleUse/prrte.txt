Use Case: Use of PRRTE (PMIx Reference Run-Time Environment) to launch and supervise processes on distributed computing systems such as high-performance clusters.

Code Details and Examples: Code

PRRTE does not involve traditional source code or input files. Rather, commands are directly run in the shell. Here are some examples of how you might use it.

1. Running a parallel program across multiple nodes:
The command "prun" is used to execute a parallel program across several nodes. It automatically starts the required runtime services on each node.

Command:
```
prun -n 4 ./your_parallel_program
```

In this command:
- "-n 4" specifies that the program should be run on 4 processes. 
- "./your_parallel_program" is the binary executable of the parallel program to run. This program could be an MPI program or any other program that utilizes multiple processes for parallel computing.

2. Heterogeneous execution:
PRRTE also supports heterogeneous execution, i.e., the ability to run a program on a cluster made up of nodes with different architectures.

Command:
```
prun -n 4 --hostfile my_hostfile.txt ./your_parallel_program
```

In this command:
- "--hostfile my_hostfile.txt" specifies a hostfile that defines the nodes in the cluster. This file is a plain text file with one hostname per line, and the format should look something like this:

my_hostfile.txt
```
node1.domain.com
node2.domain.com
node3.domain.com
node4.domain.com
```

Here, node1-4.domain.com are the names of the nodes in your cluster.

These examples show the versatility of PRRTE in the context of large-scale distributed computing. However, they are simple demonstrations, and you can use more complex command-line options and configurations based on your specific workloads and environments.
