Use Case: ParFlow is a tool that simulates groundwater and surface flow. It is often utilized by scientists for hydrological research, studying areas such as watersheds or the effects of climate change on water resources.

Code details and examples: Code:

The input files for Parflow are typically in TCL format. Common files include:

1. Simulation name file (.pfidb), includes the name of the simulation and the solver to be used.
2. Domain and Computational Grid file (.pfsol), defines the simulation domain and the computational grid to be used.
3. Parameter file (.pfiname), defines initial conditions, physical properties, etc.

Here's an example of each of these, respectively:

Simulation name file (.pfidb):
```
[Top]
name=runname
process.topology.p=1
process.topology.q=1
process.topology.r=1
solver=pfmg
```

Domain and Computational Grid file (.pfsol ):
```
[domain]
Lower.X  0.0
Lower.Y  0.0
Lower.Z  0.0
Upper.X  1000.0
Upper.Y  1000.0
Upper.Z  1000.0
nx 50
ny 50
nz 50
```

Parameter file (.pfiname):
```
[permeability]
Type  Constant
Value 1.0
```

To run ParFlow, you typically use a command of the form `parflow runname`. To run the solver and write outputs to a specific directory, for example, you might use `parflow runname -outdir output_dir`
