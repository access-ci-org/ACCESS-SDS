Use Case: The use of libXau software library is for maintaining access control lists (Acl) and for the protocol part that determines who is allowed to connect to an X Window System server. This library mainly gets utilized in computer systems to specify particular user rights to a computer's file system.

Code Details and Examples: Although libXau does not directly include any code snippets run by users, since it serves as part of a larger software structure (most commonly for Xorg, the open-source implementation of the X Window System), examples are usually presented as system-level interactions. Consider a case in the X Window System where "user A" needs to gain access to "user B's" X server. The access is controlled by the "xhost" program through libXau.

Code:

```
userB$ xhost +userA
```
This command (run by userB) adds userA to the allowed list, and the X server is then accessible by userA.

Please note that it's the software which utilizes libXau (such as the X Window System server) that needs to be executed and not the libXau itself. Its functionalities mainly pertain to the background, ensuring secure connections between various software elements within the system. Therefore, providing the exact format of input files or any specifications isn't applicable to libXau as those are determined by the software which relies on libXau.
