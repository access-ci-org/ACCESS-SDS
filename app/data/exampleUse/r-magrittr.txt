Use Case: Magrittr is an R package that offers a forward-pipe operator for chaining commands, helping to create cleaner and more readable code. It is very useful in data manipulation tasks, and for writing functional code in R.

Code details and examples:

Code:

1. Create a sequence, add 2 to each element, square the result, and calculate the mean:

```R
library(magrittr)

1:10 %>%
  add(2) %>%
  multiply_by(2) %>%
  mean()
```

input file: Not needed; operates on in-memory data structures. 

Specification and details of input files: Not applicable here.

Command to run: The above R code can be run interactively in an R session, or saved to a script file and run from the command line with `Rscript filename.R`.

2. Load data, filter rows and calculate summary statistics:

```R
library(magrittr)
library(dplyr)

data("mtcars")

mtcars %>%
  filter(mpg > 20) %>%
  summarise(mean_hp = mean(hp))

```

input file: In-built dataset "mtcars". If an external file was to be used, the read.csv function or similar would be used to load in the dataset.

Specification and details in input files: The dataset mtcars is a dataset ships with base R and represents fuel consumption and 10 aspects of automobile design and performance for 32 automobiles, 1973â€“74 models.

Command to run: This R code can be run interactively in an R session, or save to a script and run from the command line using: `Rscript filename.R`.
