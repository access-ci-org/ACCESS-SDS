Use Case: Adding optional static typing to Python

Code details and examples:

The typing-extensions library for Python provides a set of additional types that may be useful when using Python's new type hinting system. In the example below, the Literal type is used to specify that a function only accepts specific literal values.

Code:

```python
from typing_extensions import Literal

def get_letter_grade(score: Literal[90, 80, 70, 60, 0]) -> str:
    if score == 90:
        return 'A'
    elif score == 80:
        return 'B'
    elif score == 70:
        return 'C'
    elif score == 60:
        return 'D'
    elif score == 0:
        return 'F'
    else:
        raise ValueError('Invalid score')

print(get_letter_grade(90))  # Outputs: A
print(get_letter_grade(80))  # Outputs: B
```
Command to run: `python filename.py`

The input to the function `get_letter_grade` is constrained to be one of the literal values specified by the `Literal` type. This is a form of type checking that can be extremely useful for catching coding errors.

Note: While this code will run without the typing-extensions library, its main value is in the static type checking that can be done by tools like `pytype` or `mypy`. Without those tools, or without running them, the value of using typing-extensions is greatly reduced.
