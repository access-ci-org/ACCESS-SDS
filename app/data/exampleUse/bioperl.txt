Use Case: BioPerl is a tool collection of perl modules that facilitate the development of custom scripts for bioinformatics applications. One specific use case can be to extract sequence data from a FastA file.

Code details and examples:

Code:

File: sample.fasta

    >Sequence1
    ATGCGTAGCTAGCTACGTACGATCGTACG
    >Sequence2
    ATCGTACGATCGTACGTA

Script: sequence.pl

    #!/usr/bin/perl
    use strict;
    use Bio::SeqIO;

    my $filename = 'sample.fasta';
    my $seqio = Bio::SeqIO->new( '-format' => 'fasta', '-file' => $filename);

    while(my $seq = $seqio->next_seq) {
        my $sequence = $seq->seq;
        print "Sequence: ", $sequence, "\n";
    }

The script can be run using this command:

    perl sequence.pl

In this example, BioPerl is used to parse a FastA file called sample.fasta and print the sequences it contains. The input file is a standard FastA file containing sequences identified by headers that start with '>'. The headers are followed by a line (or lines) of sequence data. The output of the script will be the sequences printed to the standard output.
