Use Case: Large Scale Molecular Dynamics Simulations ; Analysis of the structure, thermodynamics, and dynamics of large biomolecular systems.

Code Details and Examples:

Code: LAMMPS

Input File Format: LAMMPS accepts input files in its own script format. These scripts typically include instructions for setting up the simulation system (defining the atoms, the interactions between them, and the boundaries) and for running the simulation.

Example of an Input File:

This script does a simple melt of an LJ system.

```
# 3d melt

units lj
atom_style atomic

lattice fcc 0.8442
region box block 0 10 0 10 0 10
create_box 1 box
create_atoms 1 box
mass 1 1.0

velocity all create 1.44 87287

pair_style lj/cut 2.5
pair_coeff 1 1 1.0 1.0 2.5

neighbor 0.3 bin
neigh_modify delay 0 every 20 check no

fix 1 all nve

run 100
```

Command to Run:
Once Lammps installation is done, we can run Lammps command in the terminal. If the script file name is in.melt, the command to run the Lammps will be:

```
lmp_serial < in.melt
```
This command will run the melt script. The output will be printed in the terminal.

Note: LAMMPS is a highly flexible and customizable software package, and there are many options and features not covered in this basic use case.
