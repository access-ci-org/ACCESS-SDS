Use Case: Bazel is an open-source build and test tool which is similar to Make, Maven, and Gradle. It uses a human-readable, high-level build language. Bazel supports projects in multiple languages and builds outputs for multiple platforms.

Code Details and Examples: 

Example Input:

A sample basic BUILD file for a java project might look like this:

```twirl
java_library(
    name = "foo-lib",
    srcs = ["MyClass.java"],
    deps = [
        ":bar-lib",
        "//third_party:foo_dependencies",
    ],
)
```
In this case, `"MyClass.java"` is the source file and dependencies (`deps`) mentioned could be another java library or third party dependencies.

---

Example Code to run:

You can build the software using the following command in the terminal:

`bazel build //main:hello-world`

In this case, `//main:hello-world` is the label of the build target. The `//` part represents the workspace directory and `main:hello-world` is the path to the BUILD file in the workspace directory.

---

Example Java Test:

A sample basic BUILD file for a java test might look like this:

```twirl
java_test(
    name = "my_test",
    size = "small",
    srcs = ["MyTest.java"],
    deps = [
        ":foo-lib",
        "//third_party:foo_dependencies",
    ],
)
```

You can run the test using the following command:

`bazel test //java/com/google/example:my_test`

In this case, `//java/com/google/example:my_test` is the label of the test target.

---

These are simple examples and the use of Bazel can become deeply complex depending on the multi-language, multi-platform project one is building or testing.
