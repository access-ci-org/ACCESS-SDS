Use Case: XGBoost is a scalable and flexible machine learning algorithm that is especially well-suited for structured and tabular datasets. It has both linear model solver and tree learning algorithms. It can handle missing values, and performs well in many machine learning competitions due to its efficiency and speed.

Code details and examples:

Code:
```python
import xgboost as xgb
from sklearn.datasets import load_boston
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error

# Load dataset
boston = load_boston()
X_train, X_test, Y_train, Y_test = train_test_split(boston.data, boston.target, test_size=0.2)

# Instantiate XGBRegressor
xg_reg = xgb.XGBRegressor(objective ='reg:squarederror', colsample_bytree = 0.3, learning_rate = 0.1, max_depth = 5, alpha = 10, n_estimators = 10)

# Fit the model to our training data
xg_reg.fit(X_train, Y_train)

# Predict
preds = xg_reg.predict(X_test)

# Compute the rmse
rmse = np.sqrt(mean_squared_error(Y_test, preds))
print("RMSE: %f" % (rmse))
```
Input:

The input can be any tabular dataset. In this example, we have used the Boston Housing dataset, which is provided with the sklearn.datasets module. This dataset has 506 instances and 13 numerical/categorical attributes. The target is the median value of owner-occupied homes in $1000â€™s. 

Running the script:
```bash
python script.py
```
