Use Case: Bowtie is an ultrafast memory-efficient short read aligner, useful for aligning sequencing reads to large genomes.

Code details and examples:

Code: The input format required by Bowtie is a set of reads in FASTQ or FASTA format. A simple example file might look like this:

    >read1
    ATGGCGTACGTT
    >read2
    TACCGTATGCTT

In addition, you also need an index of the reference genome to which you want to align your reads. This index is generated by Bowtie itself and in order to build an index for the genome, you need a file of the genome sequence in FASTA format:

    >chr1
    CGTACGTGACTGAGCTAGCTACGTGACTGAGCTAGCTGACTG
    >chr2
    CTGACTGAGCTAGCTGACTGAGCTAGCTGACTGAGCTGACTG
    
Command to build the index:

    bowtie-build mygenome.fasta mygenome
    
After creating the index, the command to run Bowtie is as follows:

    bowtie mygenome -q myreads.fastq
    
This command aligns the reads in 'myreads.fastq' to the genome index 'mygenome'. The '-q' option indicates that the input file is in FASTQ format. If the input is in FASTA format, '-f' option is required. Different options are available to adjust the alignment parameters to suit different needs.
