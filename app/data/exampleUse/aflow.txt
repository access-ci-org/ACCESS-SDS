Use Case: AFLOW (Automatic FLOW) is designed for high-throughput computational materials design. It offers an efficient way to calculate material properties, enabling the user to optimize for specific characteristics in a systematic way.

Code details and examples: 

Code:

An example of an aflow input file "aflow.in" might look something like this:

```
# AFLOW Automatic FLOW for materials discovery
# BCC Te2
# prototype: 
# Pearson symbol: cI6_19_b_a
# spacegroup: 19 
# Stoichiometry AB2

[AFLOW]
#CONTROL
automagic                       = ON
compound(1:N)	calculation_type = bandstructure_mu
compound(2:N)	calculation_type = bandstructure_mu
compound(3:N)	calculation_type = bandstructure_mu
#CALCULATIONS
compound(1:N)	K00.VASP        = 1
compound(2:N)	K00.VASP        = 2
compound(3:N)	K00.VASP        = 3
#DATA
compound(1:N)	parameter_file  = lib.aflow.crystal_prototypes/bcc/Pearson_cI6_19_b_a/Te2/AFLOWLIB
compound(2:N)	parameter_file  = lib.aflow.crystal_prototypes/bcc/Pearson_cI6_19_b_a/Te2/AFLOWLIB
compound(3:N)	parameter_file  = lib.aflow.crystal_prototypes/bcc/Pearson_cI6_19_b_a/Te2/AFLOWLIB
```

This example control file tells aflow to perform a bandstructure_mu calculation for three compounds. For each compound, it tells aflow the calculation type (K00.VASP) and the location of the parameter file.

The command to execute aflow operation with this file might look like this:

`aflow --run`
