Use Case: mpiBench is a set of benchmarks for measuring MPI (Message Passing Interface) operations' performance for high-performance computing (H.R.C.) environments.

Code details and examples:

Code:
Here is a short demonstration of how you can use mpiBench. Here, we're using it to measure the performance of the MPI_Bcast function.

```C
/* 
   The following is the contents of a source file 'mpibench.c' 
*/

#include <mpi.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char** argv) {
    MPI_Init(NULL, NULL);

    int world_size;
    MPI_Comm_size(MPI_COMM_WORLD, &world_size);

    int world_rank;
    MPI_Comm_rank(MPI_COMM_WORLD, &world_rank);

    int bcast_value = 3;

    MPI_Bcast(&bcast_value, 1, MPI_INT, 0, MPI_COMM_WORLD);

    printf("Process %d received value %d", world_rank, bcast_value);

    MPI_Finalize();

    return 0;
}
```

Input details: 

This code doesn't require any input files. It does require the MPI library to be correctly installed and accessible on the target system.

Command to compile and run this benchmark:

```shell
mpicc -o mpibench mpibench.c
mpiexec -np 2 ./mpibench
```

The output will be the message "Process {rank} received value 3". It will be printed once for every MPI process, and each one will display its own rank. 

The mpiBench package consists of several such MPI function benchmarks. Each benchmark measures a specific function, gathers statistics, and prints them for the user. The above example is quite basic and focuses only on the MPI_Bcast function. The real-world usage might involve executing complex benchmarks on a large number of processes.
