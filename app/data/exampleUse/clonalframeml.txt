Use Case: Use ClonalFrameML for measuring the clonal genealogy of a bacterial sample; tests for events such as mutations, imports, and duplications; works with bacterial genomes.

Code details and examples: Code.

1. Sample Input File: Here is a simplified sample input file in NEWICK format. Users would need a more complex, comprehensive genome sequence for actual use cases:

```
((A:0.1,B:0.2):0.3,C:0.4);
```

This example format represents a case where gene ‘A' has evolved for 0.1 units of time, gene ‘B’ for 0.2 units of time and they share a common ancestor that has evolved for 0.3 units of time. Gene ‘C’ has evolved separately for 0.4 units of time.

Please note that in reality, the input will need to be a complete set of mapped gene sequences.

2. Command to Run:

Create the following command in a shell script or run it from a terminal. Replace 'input.nwk' with the path to your input file and 'output' with the desired output path.

```
clonalframeml input.nwk output
```

User should replace "input.nwk" with the path to the actual Newick-formatted gene sequence file they are analyzing with ClonalFrameML. They should replace "output" with the directory and filename where they want the output to be saved. 

3. Brief Discussion on how to interpret output: 
The output file will contain information on various parameters including R/theta (relative rate of recombination to mutation), mean delta (average DNA import length), nu (mean divergence of imported DNA), and R (per site recombination rate). The entire bacterial genealogy will be painted by ClonalFrameML and shown pictorially as well with the different branches colored according to most recent common ancestors. 

Note: It’s essential for users to generate gene sequence data in a compatible format and feed it to ClonalFrameML plus adjust parameters as per their experiment requirement, which is beyond the purview of providing a code snippet.
