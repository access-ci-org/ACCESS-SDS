Use Case: r-backports is a package in R that allows the installation of packages from previous versions of R. It is useful when you want to make sure that older scripts still work with newer versions of R. 

Code details and examples: 

Your input would be the package you want to install from backports. For example, let's take the package "MASS" as an example.

The following code is written in R, so the required format is .R or .Rmd. The only specification is R version 3.0.0 or later.

Code:
```
# Install the backports package
install.packages("backports")

# Load the backports package
library(backports)

# Now you can install packages from backports
install.packages("MASS", repos="http://cran.rstudio.com")
```
Command to run: 

You can run this command through the command line interface by executing Rscript along with the name of the script (e.g., your_script.R). For instance

```
Rscript your_script.R
```

This will install the MASS package from the specified repository from the backports. In this case, the repository is the CRAN-RStudio repository.
