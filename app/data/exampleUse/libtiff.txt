Use Case: Libtiff is a library for reading and writing Tagged Image File Format (TIFF) images. This is most commonly used in scientific applications to handle large images and microscopy data.

Code details and examples: 

Code:

# Include necessary files
#include "tiffio.h"
void main()

{
TIFF* image;
uint32 width, height;
uint32* raster;

// Open an existing TIFF file
image = TIFFOpen("image.tiff", "r");
if (image != NULL) 
{
    // Fetch width and height of the image
    TIFFGetField(image, TIFFTAG_IMAGEWIDTH, &width);
    TIFFGetField(image, TIFFTAG_IMAGELENGTH, &height);
    raster = (uint32*) _TIFFmalloc(width * height * sizeof (uint32));
    if(raster!=NULL)
    {
        // Fetch the content of the image
        if (TIFFReadRGBAImage(image, width, height, raster, 0)) 
        {
            // Process the image code here
        }
        // Remember to free the raster memory
        _TIFFfree(raster);
    }
TIFFClose(image);
}

}

Input file:

The input file is in TIFF format, such as "image.tiff". There is no specific format required for this file as the library is capable of handling any TIFF image.

Command to run:

Compile and run the C program that uses the libtiff library. It may look something like this:

gcc readtiff.c -l tiff -o readtiff
./readtiff
