Use Case: TorchANI is a PyTorch implementation of ANI (Atomic Neural Networks) for the purpose of efficient and accurate potential energy calculation.
Code details and examples:
```
import torch
import torchani

# Load the ANI model
model = torchani.models.ANI1ccx()

# Define the molecule coordinates
coordinates = torch.tensor([[[0.0, 0.0, 0.0], [0.0, 0.0, 1.0]]], requires_grad=True)

# Calculate energy
energy = model((species, coordinates)).energies

print(energy)
```
Note: This is a basic example of how to use TorchANI to calculate the energy of a molecule. Additional input files or settings may be required based on the specific use case. Make sure to have the necessary libraries installed before running the code above.
