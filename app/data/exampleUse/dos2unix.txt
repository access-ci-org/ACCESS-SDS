Use Case: Use dos2unix to convert a text file from DOS (CR/LF) format to Unix (LF) format.

Code details and examples: Code 

Sample Input File:
A text file in DOS format. In DOS format, every line ends with a Carriage Return (CR) and a Line Feed (LF).

For example, a file named "example_dos.txt" containing these lines:
```
Hello, World!
This is a sample file in DOS format.
```

Command to run dos2unix:
```
dos2unix example_dos.txt example_unix.txt
```

This command takes in the file "example_dos.txt", converts it to Unix format, and saves the result to "example_unix.txt". 

Note:
- dos2unix does not require specific data types or format specifications beyond the need for the input to be in DOS format. 
- This command does not require any code snippets to run. 
- The input file should be in text format (e.g., .txt, .csv, .log, etc.). Non-text files may not convert properly.
- In Unix format, each line ends with just a Line Feed (LF).
