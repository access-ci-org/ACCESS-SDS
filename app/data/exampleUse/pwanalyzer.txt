Use Case: PWanalyzer is a software tool developed to simplify the input file preparation and analysis of the output for quantum mechanical simulations preformed with Quantum Espresso. It is specifically designed to work with plane-wave based DFT calculations.

Code details and examples: Code 

1. Sample input file: a typical input file ("qe.in") for Quantum Espresso:

```
&control
    calculation = 'scf'
    restart_mode='from_scratch',
    pseudodir = './'
    outdir='./'
/
&system    
    ibrav=  2
    celldm(1) =5.4307
    nat=  2
    ntyp= 1
    ecutwfc =18.0
/

&electrons
    diagonalization='david'
    mixing_mode = 'plain'
    mixing_beta = 0.7
    conv_thr =  1.0d-8
/
ATOMIC_SPECIES
 Si  28.086  Si.pbe-rrkj.UPF
ATOMIC_POSITIONS (angstrom)
 Si 0.0000000000 0.000000000 0.000000000
 Si 1.3578500000 1.357850000 1.357850000

K_POINTS automatic
  4 4 4   0 0 0
   
```

This file specifies a single-point calculation ('scf') for a silicon atom, using the 'david' diagonalization method with a planewave cutoff energy of 18 Ry. The atomic positions and a 4x4x4 k-point grid are also specified.

2. Command to run PWanalyzer with input file

After the Quantum ESPRESSO calculation has been executed, PWanalyzer can be used to simplify the analysis of the calculation. At command prompt type:
  
```
$ pwanalyzer qe.in qe.out
```

Here, "qe.in" is the name of the input file and "qe.out" is the output file from the Quantum Espresso calculation which need to be analyzed. 

The detailed instructions could be found at the official PWanalyzer documentations.
