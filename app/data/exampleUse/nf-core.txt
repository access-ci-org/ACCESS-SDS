Use Case: The nf-core is used for creating reproducible, collaborative and world-leading pipelines.    

Code details and examples: Code:

Taking the example of nf-core/rnaseq pipeline, your input files could look something like this:

You have two directories `reads/` and `results/`

The `reads/` directory should contain the FastQ files for your project. For example: 

```
- reads
  - sample1_R1.fq.gz
  - sample1_R2.fq.gz
  - sample2_R1.fq.gz
  - sample2_R2.fq.gz
  ...
```

Command to run the pipeline:

```
nextflow run nf-core/rnaseq --input 'reads/*_R{1,2}.fq.gz' --genome GRCh37 -profile docker
```

This command will run the pipeline on every pair of FastQ files it finds in the `reads/` directory. The `{1,2}` syntax is used to specify the forward and reverse reads respectively. The `--genome` parameter is used to specify the reference genome for alignment (in this case, the human genome GRCh37), and `-profile docker` is used to run the pipeline in a containerized environment with Docker. The result will be saved in the 'results/' directory.

Please note that the above input file is just an example and input parameters could vary according to the specific pipeline being used.
