Use Case: The libidn library is used for internationalized string processing. It takes in an encoded string as input and returns an ASCII-encoded string.

Code details and examples: Code

For example, let's say we want to input a domain name using the Punycode standard, a type of Internationalized Domain Name (IDN) encoding used to allow non-ASCII characters in domain names.

Sample Input File:

```text
zeichenhausö.de
```

This file should contain the domain name that you want to convert. It should be in UTF-8 format as that is the encoding standard supported by libidn.

This is a basic code snippet utilizing libidn:

```C
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <idn/api.h>

int main() {
    const char *input = "zeichenhausö.de";
    char *output;
    int rc;

    rc = idna_to_ascii_8z(input, &output, 0);
    if (rc != IDNA_SUCCESS) {
        printf("Conversion failed: %s\n", idna_strerror(rc));
        return 1;
    }
    printf("Converted string: %s\n", output);

    free(output);
    return 0;
}
```

The command to run this code will depend on your system. Typically, you will need to link against the libidn library, which you can do with -lidn when using gcc:

```bash
gcc -o test_idn test_idn.c -lidn
./test_idn
```
