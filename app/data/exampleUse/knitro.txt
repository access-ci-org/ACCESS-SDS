Use Case: Use Knitro for solving large-scale mathematical optimization problems including linear programming (LP), nonlinear programming (NLP), quadratic programming (QP), quadratically constrained programming (QCP), mixed integer programming (MIP), and mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP).

Input File: 

Knitro accepts MPS, LP, or NL (AMPL), so we will use NL (AMPL) for this example. Assume we want to solve a simple NLP:

minimize x1^2 + x2^2 

subject to x1 + x2 = 10 

Starting point (x1, x2) = (1, 1)

This can be represented in AMPL format:

```
var x1 >= 0, <= 10; /* Boundaries */
var x2 >= 0, <= 10; /* Boundaries */ 

minimize obj: x1^2 + x2^2; /* Objective */

subject to c1: x1 + x2 = 10; /* Constraint */

option solver knitro; /* Solver */
solve;
```

Reading Input File:

In Python, you can use Pyomo to read AMPL files:

```python
from pyomo.environ import *
from pyomo.opt import SolverFactory

# Create a solver
solver = SolverFactory('knitro')

# Read the model file
instance = solver.read("model.nl")

# Solve the problem
results = solver.solve(instance)
```

In Julia, you can use JuMP:

```julia
using JuMP
using AmplNLWriter

# Set the solver
m = Model(optimizer_with_attributes(AmplNLWriter.Optimizer, "executable"=>"/path/to/knitro"))

# Define the model
@variable(m, 0 <= x1 <= 10)
@variable(m, 0 <= x2 <= 10)
@NLobjective(m, Min, x1^2 + x2^2)
@constraint(m, x1 + x2 == 10)

# Solve the problem
JuMP.optimize!(m)
```

The Knitro solver can then be called from the command line:

```bash
knitro model.nl
```

This will produce output on the command line detailing the result of the optimization.
