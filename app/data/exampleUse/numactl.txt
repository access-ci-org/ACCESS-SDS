Use Case: numactl is primarily used for running processes with a specific CPU or memory placement in the Node NUMA(controlled memory and CPUs) architecture.

Code Details and Examples:
Code:

The command syntax for numactl is:
numactl [options] [--] [programs args]

1. Running a program on specific CPUs
```console
numactl --cpubind=1 program_name
```
This command will run your 'program_name' specifically on CPU 1.

2. Allocating memory on a specific node
```console
numactl --membind=0 program_name
```
This command will run 'program_name' with memory allocation from node 0.

3. Running a program on a particular cpu and memory node
```console
numactl --cpubind=0 --membind=0 program_name
```
This command will run 'program_name' specifically on CPU 0 with memory allocated from node 0.

4. Displaying NUMA policy settings    
```console
numactl --show
```
This command shows current NUMA policy settings.

Input File:
The input file format and specifications are specific to the program that you are running, and not specific to numactl itself.
