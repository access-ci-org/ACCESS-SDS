Use Case: CheckM is used for assessing the quality of genomes recovered from isolates, single cells, or metagenomes. It provides a set of tools for identifying, correcting, and removing contamination in publicly available genomes. 

Code details and examples:

Code:

1. CheckM taxon_set: Generate a file containing a set of lineage-specific marker genes.
Input File Format: 
This command does not require any input file but it needs the name of a lineage included in the CheckM tree.

Command to run: 
```
checkm taxon_set checkm_data/lineage tree_name output_folder
```
'checkm_data/lineage' is the directory of the CheckM data, 'tree_name' is the name of a lineage in the CheckM tree (e.g., 'k__Bacteria', 'p__Proteobacteria'), and 'output_folder' is the directory where the output files are saved. 

2. CheckM lineage_wf: Run a workflow to assess the completeness and contamination of a set of bins (constructed genomes) using a set of lineage-specific marker genes.
Input File Format: 
This command requires an input folder containing fasta files of the bins.

Command to run: 
```
checkm lineage_wf bins_folder output_folder
```
'bins_folder' is the directory of the input fasta files, and 'output_folder' is the directory where the output files are saved.
