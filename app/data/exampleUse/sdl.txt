Use Case: SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer) is a cross-platform development library designed to provide low level access to audio, keyboard, mouse, joystick, and graphics hardware. It is used often in game development or multimedia applications. 

Code details and examples: Code 

Let's assume that you are making a simple window in SDL. Following is an example of the bare minimal code snippet you would need:

```cpp
#include "SDL.h"
int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
    SDL_Init(SDL_INIT_EVERYTHING);
    SDL_Window *window = SDL_CreateWindow("Hello SDL", SDL_WINDOWPOS_UNDEFINED, SDL_WINDOWPOS_UNDEFINED, 640, 480, SDL_WINDOW_SHOWN);
    SDL_Delay(2000);
    SDL_DestroyWindow(window);
    SDL_Quit();
    return 0;
}
```

The above code:

- Includes the "SDL.h" header which provides access to the functions and variables needed to use the SDL library.

- Calls SDL_Init(SDL_INIT_EVERYTHING) to initialize support for everything SDL handles (audio, video, events etc). 

- Creates a window with the title "Hello SDL", dimensions 640x480 pixels. 

- Pauses the application for 2000 milliseconds (2 seconds).

- Cleans up by destroying the window and quitting SDL.

- Returns 0, indicating a successful execution.

In terms of an input file, SDL typically uses image, audio, or other such multimedia files as inputs depending on the type of the application. These files aren't provided in a specific code format but are instead loaded into the application at runtime through several SDL functions.

To compile this program, assuming the file is named "main.cpp", you can use the g++ compiler and then run the output file:

```bash
g++ -o main main.cpp `sdl2-config --cflags --libs`
./main
``` 

Here `sdl2-config --cflags --libs` provides the compiler flags and libraries necessary to build the program with SDL.
