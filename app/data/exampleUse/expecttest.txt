Use Case: expecttest is a Python library used for testing interactive command line applications. It is often used when the user wants to automate the process of interacting with a command line program; by writing both the input to and expected output from the program in a Python script.

Code details and examples:

Code:

Here is a simple example of how to use expecttest to test a command line calculator program.

```python
from expecttest import ExpectTest

# Initialize ExpectTest with the command line application to test.
et = ExpectTest('./calculator')

# Use 'send' to send inputs to the application.
et.send('2+2\n')

# Use 'expect' to verify the application's output.
et.expect('4\n')

# Close the application.
et.close()
```

This script will start the calculator program, input '2+2', and expect the output to be '4'. If the output matches the expected text, the script will complete without error.

Command to run:

To run the script, simply execute the Python file with python or python3 command.

```bash
python expecttest_example.py
```
