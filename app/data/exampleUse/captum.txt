Use Case: Captum is a Python library developed by Facebook for understanding, interpreting and visualizing input features in machine learning models. It is often used for tasks such as model interpretation and debugging, feature importance ranking, and understanding model biases and potential limitations.

Code details and examples:

Code:

```python
# Assume we already have a pretrained model named `model`
from captum.attr import IntegratedGradients

ig = IntegratedGradients(model)

input = torch.randn(1, 28, 28, 3)
# Baseline is all zeros
baseline = torch.zeros(1, 28, 28, 3)

# Compute attributions
attributions = ig.attribute(input, baseline)

# To visualize the attributions, use the visualization utility provided by Captum
from captum.attr import visualization as viz

viz.visualize_image_attr_multiple(attr, sign='all')
```

Input File:

The input file is not an actual file but a tensor in PyTorch, representing the input data to the model. It must be a tensor of the shape that your model expects. In this case, tensor has a shape of (1, 28, 28, 3), meaning we feed a one 28x28 RBG image.

To run the code above, you simply run the Python script where it exists. If the Python script is saved as `captum_example.py`, you run it with:

```bash
python captum_example.py
```

The gradients computed provide insights on the contribution of each pixel of the image to the model's final decision. The visualization would display a heatmap, showing which pixels influenced the model's decision the most.
