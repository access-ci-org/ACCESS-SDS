Use Case: Use Numexpr for high performance, multi-threaded numerical expression evaluator in Python. It is used for evaluation of element-by-element mathematical expressions on arrays. This makes Numexpr ideal for mathematical operations on large arrays, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, square root, exponentiation, and trigonometric functions.

Code Details and Examples: Code

Firstly designate Numexpr to handle and evaluate an expression. An expression will be like a string mathematical operation with the use of NumPy array variables.

```python
import numpy as np
import numexpr as ne

# initialize arrays
a = np.random.rand(1000000)
b = np.random.rand(1000000)
c = np.random.rand(1000000)

# normal numpy expression
%timeit np.sqrt(a**2 + b**2 + c**2)

# numexpr expression
expression = 'sqrt((a**2 + b**2 + c**2))'
%timeit ne.evaluate(expression)
```
In this example, three NumPy arrays (a, b, c) of size 1,000,000 are created and their square root of sum of squares is computed using both traditional NumPy method and Numexpr. In both cases, the expressions are evaluated for each element in the array.
