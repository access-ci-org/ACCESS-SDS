Use Case: Use pbmm2 for aligning PacBio (Pacific Biosciences) reads to reference sequences. 

Code details and examples: Code

Input Format: The tool requires two files - a FASTA file containing the reference sequences, and a BAM file containing the PacBio reads. 

Sample Input Files: 
1. Reference Sequence (FASTA format)
```
>seq0
AGTTGTTAGTTGTTAGTTGTTAGTTGTTAGTTGTTAG
>seq1
CGTACGTACGTACGTACGTACGTACGTACGTACGTA
```
2. PacBio Reads (BAM format) - generated by PacBio's Sequel system. 

Code:
```
pbmm2 align reference.fasta reads.bam output.bam
```

After creating your input files, you run the pbmm2 command with the "align" option, followed by the input reference sequence file, the input reads file, and the output file, respectively. This command will map the PacBio long reads to the reference sequences, and output the read alignments in the output file. This tool is majorly used in the assembly and analysis of genomes, especially in the field of genomics and bioinformatics.
