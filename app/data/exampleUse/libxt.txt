Use Case: libXt is a toolkit library for the X Window System. It is used to create widgets and manage user interface in client applications. The libXt library is used with Motif, Athena, and other X toolkits. It is generally used in graphics and UI programming.

Code details and examples: Code
A typical example using libXt would be developing a "Hello, World" program for the X window System:

```c
#include <X11/Intrinsic.h>
#include <X11/StringDefs.h>

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
    XtAppContext app_context;
    Widget topLevel;

    topLevel = XtVaAppInitialize(
        &app_context,        
        "XHello",             
        NULL, 0,             
        &argc, argv, NULL,   
        NULL                 
    );

    XtRealizeWidget(topLevel); 
    XtAppMainLoop(app_context); 
    return 0;
}
```

Details in Input Files and Command to Run them:
This code does not need an input file to run. After Saving it as my_program.c, compile it via:

```
gcc my_program.c -o my_program -lXt
```

Then, run your program:

```
./my_program
```

This will open a basic window in the X Window System. You might need to install libXt and setup X11 environment to successfully compile and run the program.
