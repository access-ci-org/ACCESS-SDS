Use Case: PanPhlAn is a tool for profiling the gene-level population diversity of a specific bacterial species or genus in complex metagenomes. It provides a quantification of the presence/absence and abundance of gene families and pathways in a sample of metagenomic data.

Code details and examples: Code.

1. Input File

- A sample input file would be a Fastq or Fasta file containing the sequencing reads from a metagenomic sample. 

Example:

> Sample1_F1
AGCTGGGCGAAATTTTGATCGGAAGAGCCATGCCTAAGGCGTGGAGTTGACCT....
> Sample1_R1
CGTAGTCGGATCCGCAGATCGGAAGACACCGTTCAGCAGGAATGCCGAGACCG....

2. Input File Format

- The input file should be in Fastq or Fasta format.

3. Code Snippet

```
# Mapping to the reference database
bowtie2 -x example_db -1 example_reads_1.fq -2 example_reads_2.fq -S example_mapped.sam

# Converting SAM to BAM
samtools view -bS example_mapped.sam > example_mapped.bam

# Sorting BAM file
samtools sort example_mapped.bam -o example_mapped_sorted.bam  

# Profiling with PanPhlAn
panphlan_profile.py --input_files example_mapped_sorted.bam --o_mapped_folder ./output_mapped/ --o_profiles ./output_profiles/
```

4. Running Command

- After installing and setting up PanPhlAn and its dependencies, you can run it through the command line using the 'panphlan_profile.py' script. This command should be run for each metagenomic sample, with the appropriate Fastq input file and output directories specified.

Note: This example assumes that Bowtie2 and Samtools, which are used for read mapping and file conversion, are also installed and correctly set up on your system. Additionally, the 'example_db' used in the Bowtie2 mapping command would be a PanPhlAn database specific to the bacterial species or genus that you're analyzing. These databases can be downloaded from the PanPhlAn website.
