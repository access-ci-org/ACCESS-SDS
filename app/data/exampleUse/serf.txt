Use Case: Use Serf; a decentralized solution for service discovery and orchestration that protects against network partitions. It is often used as a tool for cluster membership, failure detection, and orchestration in high performance computing (HPC) applications.

Code details and examples: Code 

Serf requires a configuration file in JSON format that specifies various runtime parameters. Here's a simplified example:

```json
{
  "bootstrap": true,
  "server": true,
  "datacenter": "dc1",
  "data_dir": "/tmp/serf",
  "log_level": "INFO",
  "enable_debug": true,
  "bind_addr": "192.168.0.1",
  "node_name": "node1",
  "encrypt_key": "AE8tAnNzEEIqOg=="
}
```

Save this in a file named `config.json`. You could then start serf with a command like:

```
serf agent -config-file=/path/to/your/config.json
```

This starts a serf agent using the configuration parameters specified in `config.json`. Nodes can join your cluster by invoking serf with a join command, such as:

```
serf join 192.168.0.1
```

To run some commands on the cluster, you can use the `event` command. For instance, to signal all nodes to reload their configuration you would use:

```
serf event reload
```

These are just basic examples. A real-world deployment would require more complex configuration and usage. Please refer to the official Serf and HashiCorp documentation for more details.
