Use Case: Use modeltest-ng to perform a Model Selection test that will help determine the best model of sequence evolution that fits the data, based on a given phylogenetic tree and alignment file.

Code Details and Examples: Code. 

The modeltest-ng program accepts as input a sequence alignment file in PHYLIP format and a corresponding phylogenetic tree file in Newick format.

Format Required:
1. PHYLIP Sequence Alignment file - This is a standard format for sequence alignment that includes the number of sequences, sequence length, and sequence lines for each species.
2. Newick Tree file - A standard format for tree files that represents phylogenetic trees as a set of nested parentheses.

Specification:
Your PHYLIP file and Newick file should be correctly formatted. In the PHYLIP file, you need to have the same species names for sequence alignment and tree file.

Sample Input file:
Alignment file (PHYLIP format): 

3 13

Dog ATGACGTACGTAG

Chicken ATGCCGTAGCTAG

Elephant ATCGTAGCTGACG

Tree file (Newick format):

(Dog:0.37,Chicken:0.23,(Elephant:0.56):0.14);


Command to run:

You'll call the modeltest-ng on your alignment and tree file as follows:

```
modeltest-ng -d nt -i alignment.phy -t tree.nwk
``` 

By running the command above, you are telling modeltest-ng to perform model selection on the alignment file alignment.phy, using the tree specified in tree.nwk. The -d nt option specifies that the data are nucleotides.
