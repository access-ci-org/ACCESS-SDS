Use Case: Flit is useful to manage the distribution and packaging of Python applications or libraries. It helps create a distribution package which you can distribute through PyPI.

Code details and examples:

Code: 

Create a `pyproject.toml` configuration file:

    [build-system]
    requires = ["flit"]
    build-backend = "flit.buildapi"

    [tool.flit.metadata]
    module = "sample"
    author = "Your Name"
    author-email = "your.email@example.com"

Now you can use Flit to install your project from source:
    
    $ flit install   

To build a source distribution or wheel file:

    $ flit build    

To upload your distribution to PyPI:

    $ flit publish 

Please replace the 'sample' in the above file with the name of your python module and provide your respective 'author' and 'author-email'. Input files for this package are python scripts and modules.
