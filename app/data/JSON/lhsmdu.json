    "AI Description": "LHSMDU (Latin Hypercube Sampling Multivariate Data Uncertainty) is a Python library for generating Latin hypercube samples with multivariate data uncertainty. Latin hypercube sampling is a statistical method for generating a sample of plausible scenarios by dividing the input variables into equally probable intervals and sampling once from each interval. LHSMDU extends this concept to incorporate uncertainty in the multivariate data.",
