    "Software": "FastTree",
    "AI Description": "FastTree is a tool for inferring approximately-maximum-likelihood phylogenetic trees from alignments of nucleotide or protein sequences. FastTree can handle alignments with up to a few thousand sequences and has been designed to make trees with the minimum scale up to 100,000 sequences faster by approximating maximum-likelihood with heuristics.",
    "Core Features": "Inference Of Approximately-Maximum-Likelihood Phylogenetic Trees, Support For Both Nucleotide & Protein Sequences, Efficient Handling Of Alignments With Thousands Of Sequences, Speed Optimization For Large-Scale Datasets",
