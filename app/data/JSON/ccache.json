    "AI Description": "ccache is a compiler cache tool designed to speed up C and C++ compilation by caching previous compilations. It acts as a caching proxy for compilers, storing compiled object files in a cache directory, which can be reused when the same compilation is done again. This reduces compilation times significantly, especially during iterative development processes.",
    "Core Features": "Caching Compiled Object Files For Faster Compilation Times, Transparently Intercepting Compiler Calls, Support For Various Compilers & Build Systems, Customizable Cache Size & Behavior, Tracking Dependencies To Invalidate Outdated Cache Entries",
