    "Software": "Isoquant",
    "AI Description": "Isoquant is a software tool used in economics to analyze production processes and determine the optimal combination of inputs to produce a given level of output. It is commonly used to study the trade-offs between factors of production such as labor and capital in maximizing output.",
    "Core Features": "1. Production analysis: Helps in determining the most efficient input combinations for a given level of output. 2. Isoquant mapping: Visualizes the various combinations of inputs that yield the same level of output. 3. Cost minimization: Assists in minimizing production costs while maximizing output. 4. Input substitution: Evaluates the impact of substituting one input for another on production efficiency.",
