    "Software": "Parasail",
    "AI Description": "Parasail is a SIMD C library for global, semi-global, and local pairwise sequence alignments. It is optimized for typical x86 and x86-64 architectures, automatically detecting and using AVX, AVX2, and/or SSE4.1 vectorization as well as the KNC instruction set when available. Parasail includes the Smith-Waterman-Gotoh algorithm for local alignments and the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm for global alignments.",
    "Core Features": "1. Efficiently performs global, semi-global, and local pairwise sequence alignments.\n2. Utilizes SIMD optimizations for optimized performance.\n3. Supports various sequence alignment algorithms like Smith-Waterman-Gotoh and Needleman-Wunsch.\n4. Written in C for easy integration into existing codebases.",
