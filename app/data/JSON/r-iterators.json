    "AI Description": "r-iterators is a library in R that provides a collection of iterator constructs for R, allowing for efficient iteration over objects without the need to load them into memory all at once.",
    "Core Features": "1. Enables efficient iteration over large objects in R\n2. Allows for lazy evaluation of elements in R objects\n3. Supports various types of iterators such as next, hasNext, reset, and clone\n4. Facilitates processing of large datasets or complex objects without overwhelming memory resources",
