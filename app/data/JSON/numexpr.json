    "Software": "numexpr",
    "AI Description": "Numexpr is a fast numerical expression evaluator for NumPy. With it, expressions that operate on arrays (like '3*a+4*b') are accelerated and use less memory than doing the same calculation in Python. In addition, its multi-threaded capabilities can make use of all your cores in a CPU.",
    "Core Features": "Accelerated Numerical Expression Evaluation For Numpy Arrays, Optimized For Performance & Memory Usage, Multi-Threaded Capabilities For Improved Speed Using Multiple Cpu Cores",
