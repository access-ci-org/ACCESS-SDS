    "Software": "VirtualGL",
    "AI Description": "VirtualGL is an open-source toolkit that enables the 3D acceleration of applications that are running on a remote server. It redirects the 3D rendering commands from a Unix/Linux OpenGL application onto a server-side GPU and converts the rendered 3D images into a video stream that is sent to the client-side for display using a high-speed network connection.",
    "Core Features": "Enables 3D Acceleration Of Applications On Remote Servers, Supports Opengl Applications On Unix/Linux Systems, Utilizes Server-Side Gpu For Rendering, Transmits Rendered 3D Images To The Client-Side For Display",
    "General Tags": "Remote Rendering, Gpu Acceleration, Opengl Applications, Network Streaming",
    "Software Type": "Graphics Software",
    "Software Class": "Desktop Application",
