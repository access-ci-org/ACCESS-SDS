    "Software": "LD Score Regression (LDSC)",
    "AI Description": "LD Score Regression (LDSC) is a computational tool used for estimating heritability from summary statistics of genome-wide association studies (GWAS). It leverages linkage disequilibrium information from reference populations to estimate genetic correlations among different traits or diseases.",
    "Core Features": "1. Estimating heritability from GWAS summary statistics\n2. Estimating genetic correlations among traits or diseases\n3. Utilizing linkage disequilibrium information from reference panels\n4. Conducting partitioned heritability analysis\n5. Performing LD score regression analysis",
