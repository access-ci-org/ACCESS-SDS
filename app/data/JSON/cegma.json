    "AI Description": "CEGMA (Core Eukaryotic Genes Mapping Approach) is a pipeline for predicting core eukaryotic genes in genome assemblies. It is designed to identify a set of conserved genes that are expected to be present in all eukaryotic genomes. CEGMA is commonly used for evaluating the completeness and quality of genome assemblies.",
