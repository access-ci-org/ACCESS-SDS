    "Software": "NGSadmix",
    "AI Description": "NGSadmix is a software tool used for analyzing genetic admixture, which is the result of mixing genetic material from different ancestral populations within a population or individual. It is specifically designed to estimate individual admixture proportions and infer the number of ancestral populations contributing to a target population.",
    "Core Features": "Estimation Of Individual Admixture Proportions, Identification Of Ancestral Populations Contributing To A Target Population, Model-Based Approach For Genetic Admixture Analysis",
