    "AI Description": "Pangolin is a software tool developed for assigning lineages to SARS-CoV-2 sequences. It uses a phylogenetic tree-based approach to assign viral lineages based on the mutation profiles of the sequences. Pangolin is widely used in tracking the evolution and spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.",
    "Core Features": "1. Lineage assignment for SARS-CoV-2 sequences.\n2. Phylogenetic tree-based lineage determination.\n3. Monitoring the viral evolution and spread.\n4. Integration with various bioinformatics tools and databases.",
