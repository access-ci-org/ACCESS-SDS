Sequences that were initially identified as “unclassified” are compared to all of the groups using position specific log-odds scores as described by Henikoff and Henikoff. Positions in the aligned sequences that are important for determining group membership are identified by having a high entropy for the entire alignment and a high entropy for one or more specific groups.

go,"Aces, Darwin, Expanse, Faster, Kyric, Ookami",,Programming Language,,,"Go is expressive, concise, clean, and efficient. Its concurrency mechanisms make it easy to write programs that get the most out of multicore and networked machines, while its novel type system enables flexible and modular program construction. Go compiles quickly to machine code yet has the convenience of garbage collection and the power of run-time reflection. It's a fast, statically typed, compiled language that feels like a dynamically typed, interpreted language.

It's possible to have matched files, missing files, files that have moved in the set, and to find new files not in the set. Hashdeep can report all of these conditions. It can even spot hash collisions, when an input file matches a known file in one hash algorithm but not in others. The results are displayed in an audit report.

Based on an extension of BWT for graphs (Sirén et al. 2014), we designed and implemented a graph FM index (GFM), an original approach and its first implementation. In addition to using one global GFM index that represents a population of human genomes, HISAT2 uses a large set of small GFM indexes that collectively cover the whole genome. These small indexes (called local indexes), combined with several alignment strategies, enable rapid and accurate alignment of sequencing reads. This new indexing scheme is called a Hierarchical Graph FM index (HGFM).
