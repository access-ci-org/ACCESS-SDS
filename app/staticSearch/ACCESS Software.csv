gent,bridges,,,,,"GeNT is a FORTRAN program that computes the cross entropy for groups of sequences that have been assigned to groups on the basis of biochemical,physiological, or other biological property. The sequence assignments are cross-validated, again by the cross entropy measure, to check for problems with the alignment or group assignment. Sequences that were initially identified as “unclassified” are compared to all of the groups using position specific log-odds scores as described by Henikoff and Henikoff. Positions in the aligned sequences that are important for determining group membership are identified by having a high entropy for the entire alignment and a high entropy for one or more specific groups.

It's possible to have matched files, missing files, files that have moved in the set, and to find new files not in the set. Hashdeep can report all of these conditions. It can even spot hash collisions, when an input file matches a known file in one hash algorithm but not in others. The results are displayed in an audit report.

In addition to using one global GFM index that represents a population of human genomes, HISAT2 uses a large set of small GFM indexes that collectively cover the whole genome. These small indexes (called local indexes), combined with several alignment strategies, enable rapid and accurate alignment of sequencing reads.
