Use Case: Predicting molecular properties using a message passing neural network in chemprop

Code details and examples:

Code:

The input file for ChemProp is a CSV file with SMILES strings. In the example, we have a simple molecule structure represented as a SMILES string, like:

`Cn1cnc2c1c(=O)n(c(=O)n2C)C "compound1"`

`CC(=O)OC1=CC=CC=C1C(=O)O "compound2"`

SMILES (Simplified molecular-input line-entry system) is a specification for representing the structure of chemical species using short ASCII strings.

After creating your dataset file, you can train a model using the following command:

`python train.py --data_path data.csv --dataset_type classification --split_type random --ensemble_size 5 --num_folds 5 --epochs 30 --batch_size 50`

Where:

- `--data_path` is the path to your SMILES CSV file
- `--dataset_type` classification or regression
- `--split_type` how to split your data (random, scaffold, or time)
- `--ensemble_size` number of models to train in the ensemble
- `--num_folds` number of folds to use in cross-validation
- `--epochs` number of training epochs
- `--batch_size` size of mini-batches
