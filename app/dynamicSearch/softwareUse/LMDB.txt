Use Case: LMDB is a software library that provides a disk-map capability. The library is designed to provide a C library interface for applications that need to manipulate a persistent key-value store on disk. 

Code details and examples: 

Code:

Here's an example of using LMDB in Python:

```python
import lmdb

# Open LMDB database.
env = lmdb.open('/path/to/mylmdb')

# Write to the database.
with env.begin(write=True) as txn:
    txn.put(b'key', b'value')

# Read from the database.
with env.begin() as txn:
    print(txn.get(b'key'))

# Close the database.
env.close()
```

In this example, '/path/to/mylmdb' is a string that specifies the directory in which the LMDB database resides. The 'b' before 'key' and 'value' is used to convert the strings to bytes, as LMDB operates on bytes.

Command to run: 

```
python lmdb_example.py
```

Note: The name of the python script is `lmdb_example.py`. Please replace it with your script name. 

This command assumes that the Python script is named lmdb_example.py and that it is located in the same directory where the command is run. It also assumes that Python is installed and available in your command line environment.
