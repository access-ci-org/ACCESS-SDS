Use Case: AXL is an open source library for dealing with XML data. It is especially useful for manipulating XML trees, parsing XML files, encoding/decoding XML properties, etc. 

Code details and examples: 

Code:

First, include the AXL library in your code:

```c
#include <axl.h>
```

Next, create an XML document and add nodes:

```c
/* create an XML document */
axlDoc * doc = axl_doc_new ();

/* create root node */
axlNode * root = axl_node_create ("root");

/* append root to the document */
axl_doc_set_root (doc, root);

/* create child node */
axlNode * child = axl_node_create ("child");

/* append child to the root */
axl_node_add_child (root, child);

/* set an attribute for the child */
axl_node_set_attribute (child, "attribute", "value");
```

Finally, write the XML document to a file:

```c
axlStream * stream = axl_stream_file_open ("path_to_file.xml");
axl_doc_dump (doc, stream);
axl_stream_close (stream);
axl_doc_free (doc);
```

To run this code, use the following command:

```
gcc -o test -I/usr/include/axl -laxl test.c
./test
```

This compiles your C program (named 'test.c') and links it with the AXL library. The resultant executable is named 'test'. 

Please ensure that the required input file path is accessible and the file does contain valid XML code.

Note: File operation permission and location need to be taken care of. The XML document generated will be stored in the location provided with the name 'path_to_file.xml'. The program must be compiled with the `-laxl` option to link the AXL library.
