Use Case: libpciaccess is an HPC software used to simplify the process of programming with PCI. It provides developers access to PCI configuration space, device mapping, interrupts and other services.

Code details and examples: 

Code:

```c
#include <pciaccess.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
    struct pci_device *dev;
    int err;
    pci_system_init();
    /* iterate over all devices */
    for (dev = pci_device_next(NULL); dev != NULL; dev = pci_device_next(dev)) {
        printf("Device: %04x:%02x:%02x.%d\n", dev->domain, dev->bus,
               dev->dev, dev->func);
    }
    pci_system_cleanup();
    return 0;
}
```

The command to compile and run the code:

```bash
$ gcc -o test -lpciaccess test.c
$ ./test
```

Input File Format: No input file needed. The code interacts directly with system hardware.

Specifications and Details in Input Files: Not applicable for this software package as it directly works with the system PCI configuration.
