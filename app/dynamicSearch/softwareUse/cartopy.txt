Use Case: Plotting a simple global map using Cartopy, a Python package used for geographic data processing in order to produce maps and other geospatial data analyses. 

Code details and examples:

Code:
```python
# Import necessary libraries
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import cartopy.crs as ccrs

# Create a new figure, and set its projection
fig = plt.figure()
ax = fig.add_subplot(1, 1, 1, projection=ccrs.Robinson())

# Set the title for the figure
ax.set_title("A Global Map")

# Draw coastlines onto the figure
ax.coastlines()

# Display the figure
plt.show()
```

The above code uses inbuilt functions, scripts, and datasets provided by Cartopy. There will not be any specific input file formats as Cartopy primarily works with standard GIS formats. 

To run the code, it's the standard Python command: 
```bash
python filename.py
```
Where filename.py is the filename of your Python script containing the above Cartopy code.
