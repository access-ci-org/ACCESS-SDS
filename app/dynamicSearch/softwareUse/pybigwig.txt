Use Case: Use PyBigWig to read and write genomic data in the BigWig format.

Code Details and Examples: 

The required input file format for PyBigWig is a BigWig file. BigWig is a data format used in bioinformatics for storing large, ordered, continuous sets of numerical data, specifically genomic data. The BigWig file records a list of chromosome, start position, end position, and value, grouped by chromosome.

Code:

```
import pyBigWig

# Opening BigWig file for reading
bw = pyBigWig.open("my_file.bw")

# Check if the file was opened successfully
if not bw.isBigWig():
    raise Exception("Not a BigWig file")

# Get all of the chromosome name
chroms = bw.chroms()

# Getting stats of a region
mean = bw.stats("chr1", 0, 100000, type="mean")

# Close the BigWig file
bw.close()
```

Command to run:

The command to execute a Python script from the command line is:

```
python my_script.py
```

This assumes "my_script.py" is a Python file containing the above code. Note that the file "my_file.bw" should also be located in the same directory.
