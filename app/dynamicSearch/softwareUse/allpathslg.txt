Use Case: AllPathsLG is used for de novo assembly of whole-genome shotgun microreads. 

Code Details and Examples: 

Sample Input File: 

The input files for AllPathsLG are in FASTQ format containing sequence reads. A "lib" file showing the insert libraries is also required. 

A sample FASTQ file (reads_1.fastq):
```
@SEQ_ID
GATTTGGGGTTCAAAGCAGTATCGATCAAATAGTAAATCCATTTGTTCAACTCACAGTTT
+
!''*((((***+))%%%++)(%%%%).1***-+*''))**55CCF>>>>>>CCCCCCC65
```

A sample lib file (lib.csv):
```
"LIB" "TYPE" "READ_FRAG" "MEAN_FRAG_LEN" "STD_DEV"
"lib1" "Fragment" "5000" "900" "2500"
```
Code:

After preparing the necessary input files, the AllPathsLG command to run assembly is as follows:
```
run_ALLPATHS-LG PRE=INPUT_DIRECTORY/ DATA_DIR=PWD PLOIDY=1 READS=(frag_reads1=frags1.fastq, jump_reads1=mates1.fastq) REFERENCE_NAME=Name
```
Where INPUT_DIRECTORY is the directory containing input files, PWD is the current working directory, frags1.fastq and mates1.fastq are the read files, and Name is the reference sequence name.

Note: AllPathsLG is no longer maintained or supported, and the above command and input files may not work with other assembly software.
