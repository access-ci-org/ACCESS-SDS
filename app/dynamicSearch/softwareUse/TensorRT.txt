Use Case: TensorRT is a high-performance deep learning optimizer and runtime library for production deployment of deep learning applications. It can be used to optimize trained models and achieve faster inference times.

Code Details and Examples:

Code: 

Below is a basic example of using TensorRT's Python API to optimize a model, then run inference.

```python
import tensorrt as trt
import pycuda.driver as cuda
import pycuda.autoinit

TRT_LOGGER = trt.Logger()

def allocate_buffers(engine):
    inputs = []
    outputs = []
    bindings = []
    for binding in engine:
        size = trt.volume(engine.get_binding_shape(binding)) * engine.max_batch_size
        dtype = trt.nptype(engine.get_binding_dtype(binding))
        # Allocate host and device buffers
        host_mem = cuda.pagelocked_empty(size, dtype)
        device_mem = cuda.mem_alloc(host_mem.nbytes)
        # Append the device buffer to device bindings.
        bindings.append(int(device_mem))
        # Append to the appropriate list.
        if engine.binding_is_input(binding):
            inputs.append(HostDeviceMem(host_mem, device_mem))
        else:
            outputs.append(HostDeviceMem(host_mem, device_mem))
    return inputs, outputs, bindings

engine = trt.Runtime(TRT_LOGGER).deserialize_cuda_engine(open("sample.engine", "rb").read())
inputs, outputs, bindings = allocate_buffers(engine)

# Input data here would be the actual data you're using to run inference.
stream = cuda.Stream()
inputs[0].host = input_data
cuda.memcpy_htod_async(inputs[0].device, inputs[0].host, stream)
context.execute_async(bindings=bindings, stream_handle=stream.handle, batch_size=1)
cuda.memcpy_dtoh_async(outputs[0].host, outputs[0].device, stream)
stream.synchronize()
print(outputs[0].host)
```

In this code, the TensorRT model (an .engine file) is loaded and deserialized into a runtime engine. The data is then allocated in the GPU memory, the data is copied to the GPU, the model is ran on that data, and finally the result is retrieved back from the GPU.

The input file for the above code would be a model file generated by TensorRT and saved as a ".engine" file. This model file would be specific to your deep learning model and setup. The format of the input data passed to the model would depend on the specific model being used.

The command line to run the Python code is:

```
python filename.py
```

Where filename.py is the name you gave to your Python file.
