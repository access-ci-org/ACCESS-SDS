Use Case: Move_files.sh is a bash script that might be used to move files from one directory to another. 

Code details and examples: Code
The shell script might look like this:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Source directory
src_dir="/path/to/source/directory"

# Destination directory
dest_dir="/path/to/destination/directory"

# Find and move files
find "${src_dir}" -type f -name "*.txt" -exec mv {} "${dest_dir}" \;
```

This script moves all the .txt files from one directory (`/path/to/source/directory`) to another (`/path/to/destination/directory`). The `find` command is used to search for all .txt files in the source directory. The `-exec` option is used to execute the `mv` command which moves each file found to the destination directory. 

Run the script with the following command:

```bash
bash move_files.sh
``` 

In the input file, the source directory could be `/users/John/documents/` and the destination directory might be `/users/John/Desktop/`. These directories could be hard-coded into the script or passed as arguments. If passed as arguments, the script could be like:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Source directory
src_dir=$1

# Destination directory
dest_dir=$2

# Find and move files
find "${src_dir}" -type f -name "*.txt" -exec mv {} "${dest_dir}" \;
```

With this script, you could run it with:

```bash
bash move_files.sh /users/John/documents/ /users/John/Desktop/
``` 

In this case, the arguments `/users/John/documents/` and `/users/John/Desktop/` are passed to the script, moving all .txt files from `/users/John/documents/` to `/users/John/Desktop/`.
