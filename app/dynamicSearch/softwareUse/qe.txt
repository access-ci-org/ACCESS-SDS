Use Case: Quantum Espresso (QE) is a program for high-quality materials modeling at the nanoscale. It is used for electronic-structure calculations and quantum-mechanical molecular dynamics from first principles.

Code details and examples:

File format: Input files for Quantum Espresso should be in the .in format, which is a text file. The typically used pseudopotential files have a .UPF extension.

Sample QE input file (for silicon):

    &control
    calculation='scf',
    restart_mode='from_scratch',
    pseudo_dir = '/path/to/pseudopotentials',
    outdir='/temp/directory'
    prefix='silicon'
    /
  
    &system
    ibrav= 2,
    celldm(1) =10.20,
    nat= 2,
    ntyp= 1,
    ecutwfc =20.0
    /
  
    &electrons
    conv_thr =  1.0d-8
    /
  
    ATOMIC_SPECIES
    Si  28.086  Si.pz-vbc.UPF
  
    ATOMIC_POSITIONS {alat}
    Si 0.00 0.00 0.00 
    Si 0.25 0.25 0.25 
  
    K_POINTS {automatic}
    6 6 6 1 1 1

This file can be run with the following command:

    pw.x < silicon.in > silicon.out  

In this example, the input configuration specifies all the essential parameters for performing a self-consistent field (SCF) calculation on Silicon, using the PZ pseudopotential (Si.pz-vbc.UPF). Output of the calculation is directed to 'silicon.out'.

The section ATOMIC_POSITIONS provides the atomic coordinates in lattice units (since {alat} is specified), and K_POINTS defines the Monkhorst-Pack k-point grid for Brillouin zone integration. 

The `pseudo_dir` specifies the directory where pseudopotential files are stored, and `outdir` is the directory where output will be written. The `prefix` is used to tag output files. 

The `celldm(1)` parameter sets the lattice parameter in Bohr units, `ibrav` selects the Bravais lattice, and `ecutwfc` is the cut-off energy for the wave functions.

The `conv_thr` parameter inside &electrons sets the convergence criterion for the self-consistency cycle. When the energy difference between two consecutive iterations is below `conv_thr`, the calculation is considered self-consistent.
