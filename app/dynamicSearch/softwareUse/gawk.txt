Code: 

This is a simple gawk use case. Here is a text file named "students.txt" with the following content:

    John Doe 23
    Jane Smith 19
    Larry Johnson 21

The gawk code to print the name of the students with their age is as follows:

    gawk '{print $1,$2,"is",$3,"years old."}' students.txt

So the command to run the script with the input file is:

    gawk '{print $1,$2,"is",$3,"years old."}' students.txt

This will result in the following output:

    John Doe is 23 years old.
    Jane Smith is 19 years old.
    Larry Johnson is 21 years old.
