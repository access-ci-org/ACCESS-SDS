Use Case: SPAdes is used for genome assembly and research. It can handle datasets with only a single short-read library; accepts multiple paired-end and mate-pair libraries.

Code details and examples: Code

The input file format required is FastQ or FastA. SPAdes works with IonTorrent, PacBio, Oxford Nanopore and Illumina Paired-End data. For paired-end data, a set of left reads and right reads are required. 

Sample input file (FastQ):
@SEQ_ID
GATTTGGGGTTCAAAGCAGTATCGATCAAATAGTAAATCCATTTGTTCAACTCACAGTTT
+
!''*((((***+))%%%++)(%%%%).1***-+*''))**55CCF>>>>>>CCCCCCC65

Command to run SPAdes:

```
spades.py -o output_dir -1 pe_1.fastq -2 pe_2.fastq
```

This command will run SPAdes with the output directed to the directory "output_dir". `-1 pe_1.fastq` and `-2 pe_2.fastq` specifies the forward and reverse paired-end reads.

For a hybrid assembly that includes short Illumina reads and long Oxford Nanopore or Pacbio reads, you can use the `--nanopore` or `--pacbio` options.

```
spades.py -o output_dir -1 illumina_reads_1.fastq -2 illumina_reads_2.fastq --nanopore nanopore_reads.fastq
```

The command above represents a hybrid assembly with Illumina (`-1` and `-2` options) and Oxford Nanopore (through the `--nanopore` option) reads. 

For a single-cell assembly, use the `--sc` option:

```
spades.py --sc -o output_dir -1 sc_reads_1.fastq -2 sc_reads_2.fastq
```

In the above command, `--sc` specifies that it is a single-cell assembly. The `-1` and `-2` specify forward and reverse reads.
