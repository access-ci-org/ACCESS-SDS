Use Case: SNAP is a fast and accurate aligner for short DNA reads. It is designed to align reads from next-gen sequencing machines, such as Illumina HiSeq, to a large reference genome, such as the hg19 human genome or the bosTau7 cow genome. 

Code details and examples:

Code: 
```
./snap-aligner index human_genome.mfa index/hg19
./snap-aligner single index/hg19 read.fastq â€“o aligned.sam
```

Example of Input data (fastq file):

```
@seq-id
AGTTCCAGTGTGGTGAGTGTTGAGTTGTTGTG
+seq-id
FHHHHHJJJJJJJIJJIJJJJJIJJJJJJIJJ
```

Details in Input Files: 
There are four lines for each sequence:
1. Begins with '@' character and is followed by sequence identifier.
2. The raw sequence letters.
3. Begins with a '+' character and is optionally followed by the same sequence identifier (and any description) again.
4. Encodes the quality values for the sequence in Line #2, and must contain the same number of symbols as letters in the sequence.

Format Required: Input files for SNAP should be in FASTQ or BAM format, containing the sequence data that needs alignment.

Command: 
1. The first command builds an index of the genome, where `human_genome.mfa` is your multi-fasta file with your reference genome and `index/hg19` for instance is the directory that the index will be located in.
2. The second command aligns the reads found in `read.fastq` to the `hg19` index and outputs the aligned reads to the `aligned.sam` file.
