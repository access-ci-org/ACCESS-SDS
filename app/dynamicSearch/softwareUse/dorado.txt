Use Case: Dorado is a Python library commonly used for Lagrangian transport modeling. It can be used for approximating solutions to the equations governing fluid motion by tracking the movement of particles in the fluid.

Code details and examples:

Code:

### Importing Dorado and related libraries

```python
import numpy as np
import Dorado
from Dorado.swampy import landscape
```

### Creating a hypothetical uniform flow field

```python
L = landscape([100, 100])
L.random_flow()
```

## Initializing particles

```python
particles = Dorado.particle_track.Particles(L, [50], [50])
```

## Advancing particles in the flow field

```python
Dorado.plotting.plotter(particles)
for i in range(10):
    particles.advance_until_time(0.1)
    Dorado.plotting.plotter(particles)
```
To run the code, save it as a .py file and run the Python script with python filename.py from the command line.
