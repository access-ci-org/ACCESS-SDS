An explanation of the input/output parameters follows:
T/V    : Wall time / encoded variant.
N      : The order of the coefficient matrix A.
NB     : The partitioning blocking factor.
P      : The number of process rows.
Q      : The number of process columns.
Time   : Time in seconds to solve the linear system.
Gflops : Rate of execution for solving the linear system.

The following parameter values will be used:

N      :  1000  2000  5000 10000
NB     :   150 
PMAP   : Row-major process mapping
P      :     1 
Q      :     1 
PFACT  :   1.0 
NBMIN  :     4 
NDIV   :     2 
RFACT  :   1.0 
BCAST  :   1ringM 
DEPTH  :     1 
SWAP   : Mix (threshold = 64)
L1     : transposed form
U      : transposed form
EQUIL  : yes
ALIGN  : 8 double precision words
```

In the above HPL.dat input file, N is the problem size, NB is the block size, P and Q are the dimensions of the process grid, Time is the execution time in seconds, and Gflops is the speed. Other parameters are used to adjust the performance. The input parameters should be adjusted according to the specific needs of your particular use case. Always refer to the official HPL documentation for up-to-date and detailed information about the parameters.
