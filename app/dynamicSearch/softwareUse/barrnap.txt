Use Case: Barrnap (BAsic Rapid Ribosomal RNA Predictor) is used in bioinformatics to predict the location and type of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes in genomes of bacteria, archaea and metagenomes.

Code details and examples:

Code: 

Input File: A fasta file is required as input for barrnap. 

Format: Fasta file format (A text-based format for representing either nucleotide sequences or peptide sequences, in which nucleotides or amino acids are represented using single-letter codes)

Details in input files: The input file must contain the genomic sequence(s) for which you want to predict rRNA locations.

Code Snippet:


```python
# First, you may run Barrnap as follows:
./barrnap bacterial_genome.fasta > predicted_rRNAs.gff

# Here 'bacterial_genome.fasta' is your input file & 'predicted_rRNAs.gff' is output file.
# To run Barrnap on a metagenome where the source could be either bacteria or archaea, you can run:

./barrnap --kingdom arc bacterial_metagenome.fasta > predicted_rRNAs_bacteria.gff
./barrnap --kingdom bac bacterial_metagenome.fasta > predicted_rRNAs_archaea.gff

# The '--kingdom' switch can be set to either 'arc' for archaea or 'bac' for bacteria. Use this switch if you know your source.
# If you do not specify '--kingdom', Barrnap will predict rRNAs from all known 'domains of life', i.e., bacteria, archaea, mitochondria, and eukaryota. 
```

Command to run the code:

```bash
# Change the path to your fasta sequence and add the path to your Barrnap executable if necessary
./barrnap bacterial_genome.fasta > predicted_rRNAs.gff
```
