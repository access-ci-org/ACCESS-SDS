Use Case: ecBuild is a versatile tool utilized in the setup of a CMake build system, aiding in the easy management and building of large-scale software projects. It is commonly deployed in the development of meteorological, oceanographic and climate software systems.

Code Details and Examples: 

Code:
In providing a basic example, let's assume you have a project called `test`, and you have your source code in a directory named `src` under `test`. For instance, our directory structure now looks like:

```
/test
     CMakeLists.txt
     /src
       foo.cpp
```

And we have the following contents in `CMakeLists.txt`:

```
ecbuild_declare_project()

# add test code
ecbuild_add_library(

TARGET  mylibrary
SOURCES src/foo.cpp
)

```
Above, `TARGET` refers to the name of the library we want to create, and `SOURCES` refers to the source files to compile.

Command to Run: To use ecBuild for building this project, navigate to the root directory of the project (where `CMakeLists.txt` is) and use the following commands:

```
mkdir build
cd build
ecbuild ..
make
```

These commands generate a build directory, navigate into it, configure the build using ecBuild, and build the project using `make`.
