Use Case: Caching of web content, high traffic load balancing, improving website load times, bandwidth throttling.

Code:

Here's an example configuration file for Squid:

```
acl mynetwork src 192.168.1.0/24 192.168.2.0/24
http_access allow mynetwork
http_port 3128
cache_dir ufs /var/spool/squid 100 16 256
access_log /var/log/squid/access.log squid
refresh_pattern ^ftp:       1440    20%     10080
refresh_pattern ^gopher:    1440    0%      1440
refresh_pattern -i (/cgi-bin/|\?) 0 0% 0
refresh_pattern .       0   20%     4320
```

This configuration sets up a basic caching proxy for two networks (192.168.1.0/24 and 192.168.2.0/24) to use, logs access to the proxy, defines how frequently various types of content are refreshed from the source servers, and tells Squid where to listen for requests and where to store cached files.

To run Squid with this configuration, the command would be:

`squid -k parse` and `squid -z` -> to initialize cache directories.
`squid` -> To run squid.

And to stop:
`squid -k shutdown`
