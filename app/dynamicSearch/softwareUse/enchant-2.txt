Use Case: Use enchant-2 for spelling correction in multiple languages or word suggestions. It is useful in applications such as text editors, spell checkers, and applications that require dictionary check.

Code Details and Examples: Code

Import the enchant library:
```python
import enchant
```

To check if a word exists in a specific dictionary:
```python
d = enchant.Dict("en_US")
print(d.check("Hello"))  # Returns True if the word exists
```

The input file should contain the words to be checked. Each word should be on a new line. For example,
```
Hello
Halp
```

To suggest possible corrections for a misspelled word:
```python
print(d.suggest("Hllo"))  # Returns a list of suggestions
```

You can also add to the dictionary:
```python
d.add("Ninjanuity")
```

The command to run a python file containing enchant code would be:
```bash
python filename.py
```
It's important to note that the 'enchant' library needs the dictionaries of the languages you intend to use. The dictionaries are not provided by 'enchant' itself.
