Use Case: MetaBAT, an efficient tool designed to automatically group large sets of genomic contigs into individual bins, which represent a single species or a population. 

Code details and examples: 

Input file: A file of contigs in FASTA format, and a text file of contig depth information

Input file sample:

FASTA file:
>Contig0001
ATGGCGTGCTTGAGCGTCGTAGTTCGTCGCGTCCGCTGTTTGTCGTTGTCGTGTCGTG

Depth file:
contigName, contigLen, totalAvgDepth, t1, t2,...
Contig0001, 2200, 20, 18,19,...

Command to run MetaBAT:
```
metabat -i input.fasta -a depth.txt -o bins_dir/bin -v
```
Where,
-i: input file in FASTA format
-a: depth file
-o: output bin prefix
-v: verbose mode

This command will output a series of FASTA files in the specified output directory, each representing a different bin determined by MetaBAT. The name of each output file will be in the format `bin.<bin number>.fasta`, where `<bin number>` is the bin number assigned by MetaBAT.

Note: It's important that input files and specification details are accurate in order to fetch reliable results. Preprocessing of data and understanding of MetaBAT functionalities can go a long way in utilizing this bioinformatics software.
