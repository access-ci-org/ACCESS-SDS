Use Case: Use actc to convert triangle strips from multiple indexed input files to a single indexed output file with a reduced number of draw calls.

Code details and examples:

Code: 

Input file format: 

The input file should be in .ply format. A ply file includes vertices and faces of the polygon mesh.
It starts with the list of vertices denoted by the keyword "vertex", where each vertex is represented by X, Y, Z values.
Then, the list of faces is given, each represented by the vertex indices that form the face. 

A sample could be:

ply
format ascii 1.0
element vertex 3
property float x
property float y
property float z
element face 1
property list uchar int vertex_indices
end_header 
0 0 0
0 1 1
1 0 0
3 0 2

Code:

actc -o output.ply input1.ply input2.ply

The above command takes input1.ply and input2.ply files, combines them and reduces the number of draw calls, then writes the output into output.ply. 

NOTE: Make sure the .ply files should be in the same directory as of actc.
