Use Case: The Proj library is used for performing cartographic projections and related coordinate transformations.

Code Details and Examples:

Code:

```
from pyproj import Proj, transform

# Define a projection with Proj - in this case, WGS84
p1 = Proj(init='epsg:4326')
# Another projection, this time UTM zone 15 (Missouri, USA)
p2 = Proj(init='epsg:26915')
# Transform points between these two coordinate systems
# Schenck Forest at NCSU campus
lon = -78.675
lat = 35.803
utm_coords = transform(p1, p2, lon, lat)
print(utm_coords)
```
Input files: There are no input files required.

Formatting: Coordinates are passed as function parameters. There is no specific input format required, but coordinates must be provided in decimal degrees (for latitude and longitude).

Specifications: The Proj function takes an 'init' parameter that specifies the EPSG code for the desired coordinate system.

Command to run: This is a script; no specific command to run is needed after executing the python script.

Note: Depending on the version of the pyproj, the methodology varies. The PROJ string should be used to initialize the projection, like Proj("epsg:4326"), instead of Proj(init='epsg:4326') in older versions.

Python version 3.5 and above supports this library.
