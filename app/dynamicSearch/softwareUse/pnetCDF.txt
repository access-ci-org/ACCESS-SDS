Use Case: Parallel netCDF (PnetCDF) is a high-performance I/O library that provides an interface for manipulating data stored in netCDF format, primarily used in scientific applications that need to process large-scale multidimensional data.

Code details and examples: 

A typical netCDF dataset in PnetCDF is manipulated using various functions provided by the library:

Code:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
#include netcdf.h>

#define FILE_NAME "test.nc"
#define DIM0_NAME "x"
#define DIM_SIZE 4

int main() {
  int ncid, varid, dimids[1];
  int data_out[DIM_SIZE] = {0, 10, 20, 30};

  nc_create(FILE_NAME, NC_CLOBBER, &ncid);
  nc_def_dim(ncid, DIM0_NAME, DIM_SIZE, &dimids[0]);
  nc_def_var(ncid, "data", NC_INT, 1, dimids, &varid);
  nc_enddef(ncid);

  nc_put_var_int(ncid, varid, &data_out[0]);

  nc_close(ncid);

  return 0;
}
```

This C program creates a new netCDF file named "test.nc" with a single dimension "x" of size 4, and a variable "data" of size 4. The "data" variable is then populated with four integer values.

To compile and run this code, we may need to specify the include and library paths for the netCDF library, which might look like this:

Command to run:

```
gcc -I /path/to/netcdf/include -L /path/to/netcdf/lib -lnetcdf -o test test.c
./test
```

Note: Please replace "/path/to/netcdf/include" and "/path/to/netcdf/lib" with the actual paths to the netCDF include files and libraries. Usually these paths can be obtained by running "nc-config --cflags" and "nc-config --flibs" respectively.
