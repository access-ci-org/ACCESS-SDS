Use Case: HOMER (Hypergeometric Optimization of Motif EnRichment) is a suite of tools for Motif Discovery and ChIP-Seq analysis. It is developed as a general tool for analyzing ChIP-Seq data, and includes a number of features specifically designed for this. 

Code details and examples:

Code:
The basic command in HOMER is findMotifsGenome.pl, which accepts a list of peak locations in the genome (in BED format) and the genome in which to locate the peaks.

Sample BED input file: 
chr1	1000	5000	peak1
chr1	2000	6000	peak2
chr2	3000	7000	peak3

Here, the columns represent chromosome, start location, end location, and peak name respectively.

Command to run:
findMotifsGenome.pl <peak/BED file> <genome> <output directory> [options]

where
- <peak/BED file> is your input file in BED format.
- <genome> is the genome build (e.g. hg38 for human).
- <output directory> is the directory you'd like HOMER to output results and log files.
  
For example:
findMotifsGenome.pl peaks.bed hg38 homerOutput/

This will analyze the peaks in the "peaks.bed" file using the 'hg38' human genome build, and put output files in the 'homerOutput' directory. 

NB: [options] can include a variety of additional parameters to tailor your analysis, which can be found in HOMER's documentation.
