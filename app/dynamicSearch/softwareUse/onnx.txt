Use Case: ONNX (Open Neural Network Exchange) is a open format to represent deep learning models. With ONNX, AI developers can more easily move models between state-of-the-art tools and choose the combination that is best for them. ONNX is developed and supported by a community of partners, including Microsoft, Facebook, and Amazon.

Code Details and Examples: Code

ONNX examples often involve defining a model architecture, converting the model to ONNX format, or using a pre-defined ONNX model.

Here is an example of creating a simple model in PyTorch and exporting it to ONNX:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.onnx
import torchvision

class SimpleModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(SimpleModel, self).__init__()
        self.conv = nn.Conv2d(3, 64, kernel_size=7, stride=2, padding=3)
        self.relu = nn.ReLU(inplace=True)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.conv(x)
        x = self.relu(x)
        return x

dummy_input = torch.randn(10, 3, 224, 224)
model = SimpleModel()
torch.onnx.export(model, dummy_input, "simple_model.onnx")
```

This Python code first creates a simple model using the PyTorch library, then it exports the model into ONNX format. In this case, `dummy_input` is just a tensor of the same size as the input that the model expects. The "simple_model.onnx" is the name of the file where the ONNX model will be written.

To execute this Python code, save the file with a .py extension and use the Python interpreter to execute it:

```sh
python simple_model.py
```

Remember that PyTorch must be installed for this python script to be executed successfully!

This will result in a file named "simple_model.onnx" which contains the exported ONNX model. This file can later be read by ONNX-compatible tools like ONNX Runtime, ONNX.js, etc.
