Use Case: gseapy is utilized to perform Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA). GSEA can be deployed for various biological data such as proteomics and genomics to identify where defined list of genes shows statistical significance between two biological states.

Code details and examples:

Code: 

The input files required for gseapy are: 
1. Gene Expression Matrix File, typically a csv with gene symbols in first column and further columns representing different samples/conditions. Sample input format:
```
"","Control1","Control2","Control3","Experimental1","Experimental2","Experimental3"
"Gene1",0.125,0.15,0.127,0.4,0.37,0.41
"Gene2",0.321,0.35,0.328,0.3,0.32,0.323
```
2. GSEA Ranking file: A two column csv where column one has gene symbols and column two has corresponding ranking metric score. Sample format:
```
Gene_symbol   escore
Gene1234  0.56
Gene5678  -0.45
```
3. Gene sets file: File with gene symbols grouped into sets. Typically a gmt file. Sample format:
```
SetName1 gene1 gene2 gene3 gene4 gene5
SetName2 gene2 gene3 gene5 gene6 gene7
```
An example of using gseapy with these input files is shown below.

```python
import gseapy as gp
from gseapy.plot import barplot, dotplot

# Run GSEA
gsea_res = gp.gsea(data='expression_matrix.csv', # expression dataset
                   gene_sets='gene_set.gmt', # gene set database
                   cls='control.vs.experimental.cls', # cls file
                   permutation_num=1000, # permutations
                   outdir='gseapy_out',  # output directory
                   min_size=10,
                   max_size=1500,
                   verbose=True)

# Plot results
barplot(gsea_res.res2d,title='GSEA',ofname='GSEA.png')
```

To run the script you could run the command: `python gseapy_script.py` assuming the script code is saved in `gseapy_script.py` file.
