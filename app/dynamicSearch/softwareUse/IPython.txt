Use Case: 
IPython is used as a command shell for interactive computing in multiple programming languages, but is primarily used for Python. It offers rich media, shell syntax, tab completion, and history. It is a powerful tool for the scientific computing community and can help with testing, debugging and more.

Code details and examples:

Code:

```python
# Create and print an array:
import numpy as np
a = np.arange(15).reshape(3, 5)
print(a)
```

This simple code snippet imports the numpy package, then creates an array of numbers from 0-15. The reshape function then changes the format of the array to 3 rows and 5 columns. It then prints the array.

Command to run the code: 

`ipython file_name.py`

This should be conducted in a terminal, where "file_name.py" is the name of the file containing the IPython code. 

Input file details: IPython executes python code, so the input file would be a python script. For IPython specifically, this may be a .py or .ipynb file. There is no specific format required for the input file, the python script simply needs to be correct python code.  

IPython is well integrated with Jupyter Notebooks, so code might often be found in a .ipynb file. In that case, run Jupyter Notebooks by typing `jupyter notebook` in your terminal, and then click on the desired .ipynb file to open it up. You can also directly open it by providing the file name (`jupyter notebook file_name.ipynb`). 

This will open Jupyter Notebooks in your browser, where you can run individual cells of code.
