Use Case: RAPIDS; 

Code details and examples: 
RAPIDS is a suite of open-source libraries that enables execution entirely on GPUs for data science and analytics workflows. One of the components of RAPIDS is cuDF, a GPU DataFrame library, which provides a pandas-like API on the GPU. Here is an example of how you can create a simple DataFrame using cuDF:

```python
import cudf

# Create a cuDF DataFrame
df = cudf.DataFrame()
df['A'] = [0, 1, 2, 3]
df['B'] = [4, 5, 6, 7]

print(df)
```

Another component of RAPIDS is cuML, a collection of machine learning algorithms that run on the GPU. Here is an example of how you can perform k-means clustering using cuML:

```python
import numpy as np
from cuml import KMeans

# Create a random dataset
X = np.random.rand(1000, 3)

# Fit a k-means model
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=3)
kmeans.fit(X)

# Get the cluster labels
labels = kmeans.labels_

print(labels)
```

To run the above examples, ensure that you have RAPIDS installed in your environment and run the Python scripts using a GPU-enabled Python interpreter.
