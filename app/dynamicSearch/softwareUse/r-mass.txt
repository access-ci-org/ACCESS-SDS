Use Case: The MASS package is one of the most widely used tools for statistical analysis in R. It is useful for generalized linear models, robust regression, discriminant analysis, clustering, etc.

Code Details and Examples:

Code:

```R
# Load the MASS library
library(MASS)

# This example demonstrates the use of the 'lda' function for linear discriminant analysis
# We will use the iris dataset
data(iris)

# Run linear discriminant analysis using Sepal.Length and Sepal.Width as predictive variables
result.lda <- lda(Species ~ Sepal.Length + Sepal.Width, data=iris)

# Print the result
print(result.lda)

# This example showcases the use of the 'rlm' function for robust linear regression
# Create some sample data with outliers
x <- 1:10
y <- c(2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 16, 9, 10)

# Run robust linear regression
result.rlm <- rlm(y ~ x)

# Print the result
print(result.rlm)
```

Command to run: R code can be run in an R environment such as RStudio, or in the command line using the `Rscript` command followed by the script's file name. For instance, if the script above is saved in a file named `example.R`, running it would involve typing `Rscript example.R` in the command line.
