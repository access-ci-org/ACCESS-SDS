Use Case: gpustat is a Python library that allows you to monitor the utilization of NVIDIA GPUs. It can be useful in various computational tasks such as machine learning, high performance computing, and graphic design.

Code details and examples:
Code:
```
import gpustat

gpustat.print_gpustat()
```
This straight-forward code will fetch the GPU status and print it. No input file is needed, and the format required is simply a working Python environment with the gpustat package installed.

Sample output may look something like this:
```
[1] Tesla K80        | 30'C,   0 % |   109 / 11441 MB | smith(107MB)
```
This indicates that the server has a Tesla K80 GPU, which is currently at a temperature of 30 degrees Celsius and uses 109 megabytes of its total 11441 megabytes of memory. The user 'smith' is currently using 107 megabytes of GPU memory.

The command to run this Python code depends on your Python installation, but is generally either 'python filename.py' or 'python3 filename.py' where 'filename.py' is the name of your Python file containing the above code.

Please note that the use of this package requires an installation of NVIDIA drivers and nvidia-smi command line utility.
