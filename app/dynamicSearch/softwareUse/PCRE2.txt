Use Case: PCRE2 is a library for Perl-compatible regular expressions. It is used for tasks that involve pattern matching, searching, and replacing in texts. 

Code details and examples: 

In the case of using PCRE2 with a C program:

Here's an example of a basic code snippet for using PCRE2 in a C program. The program matches a pattern against an input string and prints the matches.

```C
PCRE2_SPTR pattern;
PCRE2_SPTR subject;
int errornumber;
int rc;
PCRE2_SIZE erroroffset;
pcre2_code *re;
pcre2_match_data *match_data;
size_t start_offset = 0;

pattern = (PCRE2_SPTR)"this";   
subject = (PCRE2_SPTR)"this is a test";  
re = pcre2_compile(pattern, PCRE2_ZERO_TERMINATED, 0, &errornumber, &erroroffset, NULL);
    
match_data = pcre2_match_data_create_from_pattern(re, NULL);

rc = pcre2_match(re, subject, strlen((char *)subject), start_offset, 0, match_data, NULL);

// â€¦ check rc, handle the match(es), and clean up
```

Command to compile and run the program (its name is assumed to be `main.c`): 

```bash
gcc -o main main.c -lpcre2-8
./main
```

Requirements for input:

- Pattern (`pattern`): A Perl-compatible regular expression, given as a null-terminated string.
- Subject (`subject`): The string to search within, given as a null-terminated string.
- `start_offset`: The position in the subject string where the search should start. It defaults to 0, meaning the search starts at the beginning of the subject.

The program needs to be compiled with the `-lpcre2-8` option to link the PCRE2 library. It will then match the pattern against the subject and return the matches.
