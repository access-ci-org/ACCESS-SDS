Use Case: Bioconductor; Bioconductor is an open-source project that provides tools for the analysis and comprehension of high-throughput genomics data. R is a free software environment that runs on a wide variety of UNIX platforms, Linux, Windows and Mac OS X. 

Code Details and Examples: 

Code to install a Bioconductor package:

```R
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
    install.packages("BiocManager")

BiocManager::install("packageName")
```

Replace "packageName" with the name of the desired package.

Use Case: DESeq2; DESeq2 is an R package available via Bioconductor and is used to analyze count data from high-throughput sequencing assays such as RNA-Seq and ChIP-Seq, and test for differential expression.

Code Details and Examples:

Sample Input File: A matrix of integer values where rows are genes and columns are samples.

```R
# Load DESeq2 library
library(DESeq2)

# Read in data
countData <- read.csv(file="path/to/your/data.csv", header=TRUE, row.names=1)

# Define condition (assuming two conditions)
condition <- factor(c(rep("cond1", 3), rep("cond2", 3)))

# Create a coldata frame and instantiate the DESeqDataSet
colData <- DataFrame(condition=condition)
dds <- DESeqDataSetFromMatrix(countData = countData, colData = colData, design = ~ condition)

# Run the DESeq pipeline
dds <- DESeq(dds)

# Get differential expression results
res <- results(dds)

# Order by adjusted p-value
res <- res[order(res$padj), ]
```

Command to run the code:

```R
source("path_to_your_script.R")
```
Replace "path_to_your_script.R" with the path to your R script.
