Use Case: Python37 is widely used for developing, testing and running applications that require the Python 3.7 runtime environment. It is used across a wide range of domains including web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence and more.

Code Details and Examples:

Code:

1. Python Hello World program:
```python
print("Hello, World!")
```
To run this, save the file as hello.py and execute using the command: python hello.py

2. Reading a CSV file using pandas python library:
```python
import pandas as pd

file_path = '/path/to/your/csv/file.csv'
data = pd.read_csv(file_path)

print(data.head())
```
The input file here is a CSV file. The file path needs to be replaced with the actual path where your CSV file resides.

Command to run: python read_csv.py (Assuming the file is saved as read_csv.py)

3. Simple Linear Regression using sklearn python library:
```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split 
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn import metrics
import pandas as pd

# load dataset
file_path = '/path/to/your/csv/file.csv'
dataset = pd.read_csv(file_path)

X = dataset['Independent_var'].values.reshape(-1,1)
y = dataset['Dependent_var'].values.reshape(-1,1)

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=0)

regressor = LinearRegression()  
regressor.fit(X_train, y_train)

y_pred = regressor.predict(X_test)
```
This script runs a simple linear regression on a dataset. The dataset should be a CSV file with at least two columns - 'Independent_var' and 'Dependent_var' 

Command to run: python linear_regression.py (Assuming the file is saved as linear_regression.py)
