Use Case: r-zeallot is a data manipulation tool that assigns with multiple, unpacking, and destructuring in R. Its efficient syntax design helps to avoid repetitive respelling, to traverse deeply nested lists, and to achieve more with fewer keystrokes. r-zeallot can work with data from various sources, like databases, CSV files, etc.

Code Details and Examples: Code;

1. Multiple right-hand side: The case where a list gets divided into separate values. It requires a list as the right-hand side and individual variables on the left-hand side to hold values separately.

   Code:
   ```R
   library(zeallot)
   c(name, age) %<-% list("Alice", 25)
   print(name)
   print(age)
   ```

   This will display:
   ```R
   [1] "Alice"
   [1] 25
   ```
   
2. Unpacking: This case helps when we want to unpack a nested list. It requires a nested list as the right-hand side, and variables on the left side need to be arranged according to the structure of the nested list.

    Code:
   ```R
   library(zeallot)
   c(person_info, job_info) %<-% list(c("Alice", 25), c("Engineer", "XYZ Corp"))
   print(person_info)
   print(job_info)
   ```

   This will display:
   ```R
   [1] "Alice" "25"
   [1] "Engineer" "XYZ Corp"
   ```

3. Destructuring: The case when we would like to assign values to variables from different parts of a list. Here, the structure on the left side determines how the right side gets destructured, and each value in the list gets assigned to the corresponding variable on the left.

    Code:
   ```R
   library(zeallot)
   c(name, c(job, company)) %<-% c("Alice", c("Engineer", "XYZ Corp"))
   print(name)
   print(job)
   print(company)
   ```

   This will display:
   ```R
   [1] "Alice"
   [1] "Engineer"
   [1] "XYZ Corp"
   ```

To run these pieces of code, they should be placed in an R script. The Rscript can be called from the command line as: Rscript myscript.R.
