Use Case: Use gThumb for managing, viewing, and editing digital images and photos.

Code details and examples: Code

gThumb does not support traditional command-line interaction, it primarily interacts with a graphical user interface.

Input Files: Images (.jpeg, .png, .bmp etc.)

Specifications of Input Files: Mostly any image file is acceptable for gthumb.

For interaction, a user can manually open the program and then follow on-screen prompts to view and manage image files.

However, a sample use-case via command line to open gThumb and view a particular image would be:
```bash
gthumb /path/to/image.jpg
```
And, to browse a particular directory, you could do:
```bash
gthumb /path/to/directory/
```
Here "/path/to/image.jpg" or "/path/to/directory/" must be replaced with the actual path of the image or directory you want to open with gThumb. 

Note: gThumb does not require any particular format or specifications in the input files apart from being valid image files. Since it functions as a viewer, it can display any image acceptable to it.
