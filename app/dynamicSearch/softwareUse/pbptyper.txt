Use Case: PbpTyper is a software package employed in assigning penicillin binding protein (PBP) types in Streptococcus pneumoniae, an important human pathogen. The PBP types are linked to beta-lactam susceptibility in this species. It is particularly useful for researchers and scientists in microbiology and pharmaceutical fields.

Code details and examples: Code.

Input Files:
PbpTyper requires three types of data files: 
- Amplification and sequencing primers (in CSV format)
- Reference proteins (in FASTA format) 
- Query sequences (in FASTA format)

An example of the required CSV file format can be noted as:

    Primer_Name, Sequence, Amplifies_Gene
    PBPM3f, ATGAAAAAATTTCGTGGTGGA, pbp1a
    PBP2a1F, ACTTTATTCTGTATTGGGAGG, pbp2a

For FASTA format, the format becomes:

    >gene1
    ATGGCCATCGATCGATCGATCGGGGATC
    >gene2
    CCTTACCCCCGATCGGGAAAAT

Code Snippets:

    # To run PbpTyper with default parameters:
    pbptyper query.fna

    # To run PbpTyper with custom files and parameters:
    pbptyper -q query.fna -p primers.csv -r reference.faa -o output_dir


Here, "-q" is the command for the query sequences, "-p" for the primers file, "-r" for the reference proteins, and "-o" for the output directory.
