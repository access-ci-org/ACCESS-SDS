Use Case: Autoconf is a tool used for producing shell scripts that automatically configure software source code packages to adapt to many kinds of POSIX-like systems. The configuration scripts produced by Autoconf are standalone and are independent of Autoconf when they are run, making them ideal for distribution.

Code details and examples:

Sample Input File:

You need to create a configuration script for your software. In that script, Autoconf macros and shell code can coexist. 

For instance, if your software relies on a C compiler, your configuration script, configure.ac, might look as follows:

```
AC_INIT([My Program], [1.0], [bug-my-program@example.com])
AC_PROG_CC
AC_CONFIG_FILES([Makefile])
AC_OUTPUT
```

You define the programs, header files, libraries, etc. that your software package requires in the configure.ac file. 

Autoconf replaces each AC_MACRO in the file with a test that will run on the system where the software will be compiled.

Command to run:

Once this file is made, it is used to generate the configure script via the autoconf command.

```bash
autoconf
```

This command produces a `configure` script, which, in turn, is used to generate the Makefile for your software:

```bash
./configure
make
```
