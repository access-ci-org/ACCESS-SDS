Use Case: Numexpr is a Python package that efficiently evaluates large array-like expressions in a way that saves memory and computational resources. It is commonly used in scientific computations.

Code details and examples: Code:

The NumPy library is required for the functions of Numexpr, so you would have to import both of them. A sample code is shown below, note that Numexpr uses standard Python operators and functions.

```Python
import numexpr as ne
import numpy as np

# Create NumPy array
arr1 = np.arange(1, 101)
arr2 = np.arange(100, 0, -1)

# Define your expression as a string
expression = "(arr1**2 + arr2**2)>50"

# Use numexpr.evaluate to evaluate the expression   
filtered_data = ne.evaluate(expression)
print(filtered_data)
```

The command run the above script (saved as script.py) from terminal would be: 
```shell
$ python script.py
```

For input files, numexpr works with ndarray objects typically from numpy, so a suitable method of importing data is using numpy's data import functions. For instance, if you have a CSV file 'data.csv' full of numerical data you want to use with numexpr, you can load it in using numpy's genfromtxt:

```python
arr1 = np.genfromtxt('data.csv', delimiter=',')
```

Numexpr then uses these ndarrays in its computations.
