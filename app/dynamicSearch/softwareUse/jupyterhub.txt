Use Case: JupyterHub is used to serve Jupyter notebooks to multiple users. It can be used in a class of students, a corporate data analysis group, a scientific research group, or any team that uses Jupyter notebooks for their projects.

Code Details and Examples:

Code:

The details inside a Jupyter notebook can be varied depending upon the problem that is being solved or the analysis being performed. Here is a simple Python script that can be inserted into a Jupyter notebook cell:

```python
# Import necessary libraries
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load CSV file data
data = pd.read_csv('file.csv')

# Display the first few rows of the DataFrame
print(data.head())

# Plot a histogram of the 'age' column
data['age'].plot(kind='hist')
plt.show()
```
Input files: This Python script uses a CSV file named `file.csv` as its input. This file should ideally be uploaded in the same directory as the Jupyter notebook for easy access.

Command to run: Jupyter notebooks are run cell by cell. To run a particular cell containing code, you can press `Shift + Enter` after selecting the cell. To run the entire notebook, you can navigate to `Cell --> Run All` from the menu.
