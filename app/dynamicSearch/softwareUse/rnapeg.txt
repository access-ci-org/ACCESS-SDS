Use Case: rnapeg is a powerful tool for RNA structural alignment and motif identification. It uses a combination of sequence and structural similarities to compare RNA molecules and find shared structural motifs. Especially it is used for generating alignments of RNA molecules and identifying shared structural motifs.

Code details and examples: rnapeg accepts as input a multiple sequence alignment in Stockholm format, along with an optional reference structure. The main output is a consensus structure prediction in DOT-bracket notation. 

Here is a sample input file:
```
# STOCKHOLM 1.0
#=GS AF001620/955-1028  DE Bacillus subtilis pre-tRNA-Gln

AF001620/955-1028 ACUGCAGGUUGAGUAGGGUUCAAGACUGGGGCCCCCCUCGGGGCUCAGCCUCCCACCUCGCCAAACAAGCACCGGUGGAUUCGAUAACCC
AF001620.1/955-1028 ACUGCAGGUUGAGUAGGGUUCAAGACUGGGGCCCCCCUCGGGGCUCAGCCUCCCACCUCGCCAAACAAGCACCGGUGGAUUCGAUAACCC
#=GC SS_cons         :::::::::::::::::::::(((((((,,<<<<___.._>>>>>>>,,,)))))))..((((((((((((..._))))))))))))))):
//
```

Here is the command to run rnapeg:

```
rnapeg -i input.sto -o output.txt
```

Where `input.sto` is your input stockholm file and `output.txt` is the file where you want the output to be written. 

This will generate a consensus structural alignment and writes it to the output file.
