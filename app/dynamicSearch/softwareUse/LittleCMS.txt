Use Case: LittleCMS is used as a color management engine in many different types of software, including photography software, prepress software, and even operating systems. With LittleCMS, you can manipulate and adjust color profiles to ensure accurate color representation across different devices and mediums.

Code Details and Examples:

Code:

1. Firstly, load the color profile(s):

```
#include "lcms2.h"

cmsHPROFILE hProfile = cmsOpenProfileFromFile("example.icc", "r");
```

The `example.icc` file should be a standard ICC profile file. ICC profiles are often provided by device manufacturers (for example, a monitor or a printer). If you want to convert between two profiles (for example, from one monitor's color space to another), you would load two profiles in this way.

2. Then, create a transform. This transform can be used to convert colors from one profile to the other:

```
cmsHTRANSFORM hTransform = cmsCreateTransform(
    hProfile,              // Input profile
    TYPE_RGBA_8,           // Input data format
    hProfile,              // Output profile
    TYPE_RGBA_8,           // Output data format
    INTENT_PERCEPTUAL,     // Intent
    0);                    // Flags
```

In this example, both the input and the output profiles are the same, but in practice, you would use two different profiles. The data format specifies what format the incoming and outgoing color data should be in.

3. To run a pixel through the transform, use the following:

```
uint8_t inPixel[4] = {255, 200, 100, 0};    // An input pixel
uint8_t outPixel[4];                        // Output pixel will be stored here

cmsDoTransform(hTransform, inPixel, outPixel, 1);
```

The input pixel is specified in RGBA format (red, green, blue, alpha), and the transformed pixel is stored in `outPixel`.

4. Finally, don't forget to clean up the profiles and transform when you're done with them:

```
cmsDeleteTransform(hTransform);
cmsCloseProfile(hProfile);
```

If you have created a transform with two different profiles, remember to close both profiles.

Command to run: LittleCMS functions are intended to be integrated into larger C or C++ programs, so actual command to run will depend on the individual system.

Note: Above examples are based on version 2 of the LittleCMS library.
