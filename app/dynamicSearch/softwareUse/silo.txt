Use Case: Silo is a library for scientific computing. It's primarily used for reading, writing and sharing scientific data on disk files, particularly for large, complex, time-varied, multi-dimensional data.

Code details and examples: 

Code:

```python
#!/usr/local/bin/python

import os
import h5py
from array import array as Array

# File locations
dirpath = os.path.dirname(os.path.realpath(__file__))
infilepath = os.path.join(dirpath, 'input.txt')
outfilepath = os.path.join(dirpath, 'output.silo')

# Read from input file
with open(infilepath, 'r') as fin:
    data = fin.read().split()

# Open the output file
outfile = h5py.File(outfilepath, 'w')

# Write data to file
db = outfile.create_dataset('mydata', (len(data),), dtype='i')
db[...] = Array('i', data)

# Close the file
outfile.close()
```

The input file (input.txt) for this program is a simple ASCII text file with integers separated by whitespace.

```
1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9
```
The command to run the above example would be `python example.py`.

Note that this doesn't create a .silo file per se, but a .h5 file, which is a format often used in tandem with silo and visit, tools frequently used together with Silo. To create a .silo file you can use the Silo library's functions, but Python's bindings for Silo are currently limited and may not support all features.
