Use Case: IsoQuant is a software tool utilized in the analysis of RNA-Seq data, particularly in the identification and quantification of isoforms. It includes quality control, alignment, and quantification functionalities.

Code Details and Examples: Code
 
```bash
# Run IsoQuant via the command line
java -jar isoquant.jar [options]

# Here, [options] can include one or several of the following command-line parameters:

-in <path>           # path to input files (required)
-db <path>           # path to output SQLite database report file (required)
-pept <path>         # write output peptides into file (optional)
-proteins <path>     # write output proteins into file (optional)
-annotation <path>   # annotation file in GTF or BED format (optional)

# A config file can also be used instead of command line parameters
java -jar isoquant.jar @<config_file>
```

Sample input files in IsoQuant takes data in the format of .fastq (Illumina short-read sequence data) or aligned .bam files. Here's a hypothetical structure of fastq entries:

```
@SEQ_ID
GATTTGGGGTTCAAAGCAGTATCGATCAAATAGTAAATCCATTTGTTCAACTCACAGTTT
+
!''*((((***+))%%%++)(%%%%).1***-+*''))**55CCF>>>>>>CCCCCCC65
``` 

Sample data in aligned .bam file:

```
SRR165755.1	99	chr1	10000	255	36M10000S	=	10036	36	NTCTTAGGGTTCAAAGCAGTATCGATCAAATAGTAAATCCATTTGTTCAACTCACAGTTT
SRR165755.1	147	chr1	10036	255	10000S36M	=	10000	-36	NTCTTAGGGTTCAAAGCAGTATCGATCAAATAGTAAATCCATTTGTTCAACTCACAGTTT
```

Before running IsoQuant, the input files need to be aligned with a reference genome, which could be accomplished with an aligner like TopHat or HISAT. All the used parameters are fully described and specified in the tool's manual.
