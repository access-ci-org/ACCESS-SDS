Use Case: Python libraries
Code details and examples:
Anaconda is a distribution of Python and R programming languages used for scientific computing, data science, and machine learning. It comes with a wide range of pre-installed libraries and tools useful for these purposes.

Example of using pandas library in Anaconda to read a CSV file:
```python
import pandas as pd

# Read a CSV file using pandas
df = pd.read_csv('sample.csv')

# Display the first 5 rows of the dataframe
print(df.head())
```

To run the above code, save it in a Python script file (e.g., script.py) and then run it using the Python interpreter.

Command to run the script:
```
python script.py
```
