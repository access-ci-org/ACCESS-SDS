Use Case: FastQC is a quality control tool for high throughput sequence data. It reads in sequence data and provides a modular set of analyses which can identify potential problems with the data.

Code Details and Examples:

The main input file for FastQC is a sequence file in FastQ format.

Sample Input File:
Below is a valid FastQ file. Each entry in a FastQ file consists of 4 lines. The first line begins with '@' character and is followed by the sequence identifier. The second line is the raw sequence letters. The third line begins with a '+' character and is optionally followed by the same sequence identifier again. The fourth line encodes the quality values for the sequence in the second line.
    
    @SEQ_ID
    GATTTGGGGTTCAAAGCAGTATCGATCAAATAGTAAATCCATTTGTTCAACTCACAGTTT
    +
    !''*((((***+))%%%++)(%%%%).1***-+*''))**55CCF>>>>>>CCCCCCC65

Command to Run:
The command to run FastQC is:
    
    fastqc some_file.fastq

Code Snippets:

There is no need to write code to run FastQC as it is a standalone executable software. One simply needs to install it and run it from the command line with the proper input file. 

You can however incorporate it into a shell script or a pipeline. For example,

    #!/bin/bash
    # This is a script to automate running FastQC on multiple files

    for file in *.fastq
    do
      fastqc "$file"
    done

This shell script will run FastQC on all files in the current directory that have a .fastq extension.
