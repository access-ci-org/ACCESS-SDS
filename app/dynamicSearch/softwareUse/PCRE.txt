Use Case: PCRE (Perl Compatible Regular Expressions) is a widely used library for implementing regular expression pattern matching. This library is often used in various projects such as PHP, R, etc.

Code details and examples: 

Code:

Here is a simple example of using PCRE API in C to match a regex pattern (Ref: https://www.pcre.org/original/doc/html/pcreapi.html):

```
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <pcre.h>

int main()
{
    pcre *re;
    const char *error;
    int erroffset;
    int rc;
    int i;

    // Compile the regular expression
    re = pcre_compile("a[0-9]",  // the pattern
            0,             // default options
            &error,        // for error message
            &erroffset,    // for error offset
            NULL);         // use default character tables

    // We compiled successfully, now do the matching
    rc = pcre_exec(re,         // the compiled pattern
            NULL,             // no extra data - we didn't study the pattern
            "a7",             // the subject string
            strlen("a7"), // the length of the subject
            0,                // start at offset 0 in the subject
            0,                // default options
            NULL,             // output vector for substring information
            0);               // number of elements (NOT size!) in the output vector

    if (rc >= 0) {
        printf("Match succeeded!\n");
    } else {
        printf("Match failed\n");
    }

    return 0;
}
```
Command to run:

You would run the code after saving it to a file (say `match.c`) and compiling it with the PCRE library. If your PCRE library is installed under the `/usr` directory, use

```bash
gcc -I/usr/include -L/usr/lib match.c -lpcre -o match
./match
```

This program tries to match the string "a7" with the regular expression `a[0-9]` i.e., 'a' followed by a digit, and then prints "Match succeeded!" if it matches and "Match failed" if it doesn't match. 

The input here is hardcoded in the C code file. For an actual use case, this would likely be replaced with user interface for input or file reading capabilities.
