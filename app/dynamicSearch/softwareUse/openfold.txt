Use Case: OpenFold is used for protein structure prediction. One of the core tasks in molecular biology and bioinformatics, is to predict the three-dimensional structure of a protein sequence. 

Code Details and Examples:

Code:

Here is a simple way to run a script for openfold.

```
# Import the necessary modules
from openfold.amino_acid import protein_sequence
from openfold.model import Model
from openfold.visualize import view_structure

# Define your amino acid sequence
sequence = protein_sequence('SEQUENCE')

# Generate the model
model = Model(sequence)

# Run the prediction
model.predict_structure()

# View the structure
view_structure(model.structure)
```

Input files needed: 

OpenFold requires an amino acid sequence as the input data. This data can be represented as a string. For example, 'SEQUENCE'.

Output file generated:

The output data is a structure of the protein which can be viewed using the view_structure function. 

Command to run as:

Preferably, you can run the script using any Python compiler as a .py file. Or if the script is saved as 'protein_structure.py', run it in the terminal as follows:

```
python protein_structure.py
``` 

Format required: 

OpenFold takes an input file which is just a string of amino acids. Each amino acid is represented by a single letter. The order of the letters represents the order of the amino acids in the protein.

Specifications and details in input files:

The input file is a simple text file, where each character represents one amino acid. There are 20 different types of amino acids, and each one is represented by a unique character. The input file should not contain any other characters or symbols.

Example of input file content:
SEQUENCE
