Use Case: PyGenomeTracks is a python-based tool for plotting genomic data such as gene models, DNA methylation, ChIP-seq peaks, chromatin structure and many other data types on top of each other. It is widely useful in genomics researches.

Code details and examples: Code

Input File:

The input files can be in several formats: bigWig, bigBed, bed, bedgraph, gtf, gff, narrowPeak, broadPeak, bedgraph or tdf.

Here's a simple example of a bed file:

```
chr1    1000    2000    track1 line 1
chr2    2000    3000    track1 line 2
```
This bed file contains the chromosomal location and the annotation.

Configuration of PyGenomeTracks can be done with .ini files. Here is a simple example of an .ini file:
``` 
[default]
height = 3
color = black
# the type of file could be 'bed', 'gff', 'narrow_peak', 'hic_matrix', etc.
file_type = bed
```
These settings can be used as defaults for all the other data tracks.

Command Line to Run:

To make a plot using the settings above, you could use the following command:

``` 
pyGenomeTracks --tracks track.ini --region chr2:1,000,000-2,000,000 --outFileName nice_image.pdf
``` 
This command is telling pyGenomeTracks to make a plot using the settings in the 'track.ini' file, for the region chr2:1,000,000-2,000,000, and save the plot as 'nice_image.pdf'.
