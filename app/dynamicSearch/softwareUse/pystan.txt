Use Case: PyStan is commonly used for Bayesian Inference, which facilitates statistical modeling and high-performance statistical computation. 

Code Details and Examples:

Code:

```python
# Import required library
import pystan

# Create a model with a normal distribution
model_code = '''
data {
  int<lower=0> J; // number of observed data points
  vector[J] y; // observed values
  vector<lower=0>[J] sigma; // standard deviation
}

parameters {
  real mu;
  real<lower=0> tau;
  vector[J] theta;
}

model {
  theta ~ normal(mu, tau);
  y ~ normal(theta, sigma);
}
'''

# Prepare data for the model
data = {
    'J': 8,
    'y': [28, 8, -3, 7, -1, 1, 18, 12],
    'sigma': [15, 10, 16, 11, 9, 11, 10, 18]
}

# Fit the data to the model
sm = pystan.StanModel(model_code=model_code)
fit = sm.sampling(data=data, iter=1000, chains=4)
```
Representation of Input Data File: The data required for this example is in the dictionary format accepted by Python, with integer and array values.

Representation of Input Files: No specific input file format needed, as the dataset is embedded in Python code directly. The 'data' dictionary contains a list of parameters and corresponding data values. The keys in the dictionary contain the data type and constraints, and the values in the dictionary are list of corresponding data points.

Command to Run: This code snippet can be executed by running a script that includes this code or directly in a python environment like Jupyter notebook.
