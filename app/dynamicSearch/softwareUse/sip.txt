Use Case: SIP (Session Initiation Protocol) is not a scientific library or software, it's a communication protocol. However, there is a Python module called SIP that is used to create bindings for C and C++ libraries. This can be used for improving execution performance for computationally intensive programs.

Code details and examples:

Code:

Python SIP bindings for Qt libraries:

In your .sip file:
```
%Module YourModule 1.0
%Include someheaderfile.h
```

In your main Python script:
```python
import sip
sip.setapi('QString', 2)
sip.setapi('QVariant', 2)
from PyQt4 import QtCore, QtGui
```

In this example, the SIP file includes the header of a C++ library that you are intending to bind. The command "setapi" is used to specify which version API of the target library you intend to use. After setting APIs, you import the necessary libraries from PyQt4 using a standard Python import command.

Command to build and use the bindings:
1. First, compile the SIP file to create the bindings: `sip -b file.sip`
2. Run your Python script as usual: `python script.py`

This will create the bindings and allow your Python script to call C++ functions and use C++ classes via these bindings. 

_Input file format_

The main input for the SIP tool is .sip file. This file describes the interface of the C++ library that you want to access from Python. No specific requirements or specification exists for this file. It should contain the description of public interfaces to the C++ library that you want to make available to Python.

_Note: This description details the usage of the SIP tool as a Python-to-C++ binding generator. The usage may vary for other cases._
