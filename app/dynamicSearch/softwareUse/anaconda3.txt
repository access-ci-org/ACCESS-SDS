Use Case: Anaconda is a package manager, an environment manager, and a distribution of scientific computing and data science related Python and R packages. It simplifies package management and deployment, and is used by millions of developers around the world for machine learning, data analysis etc.

Code Details and Examples:

Code:

Firstly, create a new environment in Anaconda using the command:

```
conda create -n myenv python=3.6
```

Then, activate the environment:

```
conda activate myenv
```

Once the environment is created and activated, you can now move on to using Python in Anaconda. Here is a simple Python code that uses the Pandas library to read a csv file and implement some data analysis tools:

```python
import pandas as pd

#The csv file input and the format should be as per pandas.read_csv specification
# https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.read_csv.html

df = pd.read_csv('your_directory/your_file.csv')

#Describe gives the central tendency, dispersion and shape of datasetâ€™s distribution
print(df.describe())

#Check for any null values in the dataset
print(df.isnull().sum())
```

To run this code, save it into a .py file, say, 'data_analysis.py', then you can run this python file using below command in the Anaconda terminal:

```
python data_analysis.py
```
