Use Case: Use py-six to write Python code that is compatible with both Python 2 and Python 3.

Code details and examples: Code

Py-six doesn’t require any special input files or formats. Instead, it offers a set of functions and methods that allow you to use Python 3-specific features in a way that’s compatible with Python 2. Here is an example:

```python
import six

def example_function(integer_value):
    if not six.PY2:
        return integer_value // 2
    else:
        return integer_value / 2
```

In this code, we’ve used `six.PY2` to identify the version of Python we’re using. Depending on the Python version, we’ve used different division operations. 

Command to run the above code is:
```bash
python3 filename.py
```

(Note: replace 'filename.py' with your Python file name)
