Use Case: NanoFilt is commonly used to filter nanopore sequencing data based on quality and/or read length. 

Code details and examples:

Code:

```
# Required Input File Format
# Fastq file generated from nanopore sequencing 

# Sample Input File   
# sequence.fastq

# Command to run NanoFilt tool
gzip -dc sequencing_reads.fastq.gz | NanoFilt -q 10 -l 500 | gzip > filtered_reads.fastq.gz
```

In this command, "-q 10" is the minimum quality score you want for your reads and "-l 500" is the minimum length of the reads you want to keep. The filtered data is written to the file "filtered_reads.fastq.gz". As input, NanoFilt takes the uncompressed FastQ data directly from gzip via a pipe. 

Specifications:

- Quality scores are expected to be encoded as Phred+33.
- When using extremely large datasets, manually set the number of cores.
- FastQ can be provided via standard input, allowing piping.
