Use Case: Octave is a high-level programming language, primarily intended for numerical computations. It provides capabilities for the numerical solution of linear and nonlinear problems, and for performing other numerical experiments. It also provides extensive graphics capabilities for data visualization and manipulation. Octave is normally used through its interactive command line interface.

Code details and examples: The standard format for a script file in Octave is .m. A simple script to plot a sine wave may look like this:

Code:

```Octave
% sample.m
% This program plots a sine wave
t = linspace(0, 2*pi, 100); % Create a vector t with values ranging from 0 to 2*pi
y = sin(t); % Compute sine of each values in t
plot(t, y); % Plot sinusoidal wave
xlabel('t'); % Provide an x-axis label
ylabel('sin(t)'); % Provide a y-axis label
title('Plot of the Sine Function'); % Provide a title
```

To run this script in Octave, open the Octave command line and enter the following command, assuming `sample.m` is in your current directory:

```
octave sample.m
``` 

This will plot a sinusoidal wave on the screen with the respective labels as provided in the script.
