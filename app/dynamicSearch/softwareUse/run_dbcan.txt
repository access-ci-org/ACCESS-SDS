Use Case: Run_dbCAN is a web server that predicts enzymes for Carbohydrate-Active enZymes (CAZy) families. It is used in bioinformatics to help predict, annotate, and analyze genome and metagenome sequencing.

Code details and examples: Code 

run_dbCAN is a command-line tool, and it requires FASTA files as input. FASTA files are a common format for nucleotide and protein sequences.

Here's the format of a minimal FASTA file:
```
>sequence1
ATGGCC
>sequence2
TTGGAA
```
In this example, the sequences are 'ATGGCC' and 'TTGGAA', and each of them has an identifier ('sequence1' and 'sequence2') preceded by a '>'.

Here is a command-line example to run run_dbCAN on Unix-based systems:

```
$ run_dbcan.py protein.faa fungi
```

In this example, 'protein.faa' is the input FASTA file and 'fungi' is a parameter indicating that the sequences are from fungi. The output will be a tabular file containing the predicted CAZy families for each sequence. The 'run_dbCAN.py' script and the input FASTA file should be in the current directory, or their paths should be provided.

Please note that Python 2.7 and specific databases are required for run_dbCAN, and they are assumed to be correctly installed and configured. Concretely, HMMER3, DIAMOND, and NCBI BLAST+ are requirements of dbCAN tools.
