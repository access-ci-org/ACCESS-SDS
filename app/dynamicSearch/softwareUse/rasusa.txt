Use Case: The rasusa tool is used in bioinformatics and genomics for random subsampling of sequencing reads to a specified coverage. It is mostly used when one is required to downsample their fastq files.

Code Details and Examples: 

The input file for rasusa should be in FASTQ format, a text-based format for storing both a biological sequence (usually nucleotide sequence) and its corresponding quality scores.

Sample Input file:

```
@SEQ01
AACTTGAAGACTTTGTCAAC
+
\!\040494499:<<<<<8
@SEQ02
CGAGTGCGTAGAGACGTGTA
+
[[]]^_aadfghhhhhhhh
@SEQ03
ACGACTGACTAGCATGCTAC
+
]]]_adddddddddddeee
```

Command to run rasusa:

```
rasusa --coverage 30 --genome-size 3m --input input.fastq --output output.fastq
```

Where:
- `--coverage` is the desired coverage,
- `--genome-size` is the estimated genome size,
- `--input` is the input fastq file, and
- `--output` is the output fastq file.
