Use Case: QuantumATK is used for atomic-scale modeling and simulations in materials science and nanotechnology. It provides a complete suite of features for studying both periodic and non-periodic systems, with a particular focus on nanoscale devices.

Code Details and Examples:

Code: For QuantumATK, the input file can be in the python scripting language. Here is a sample of code to run a script file with the name "MyScript.py" in QuantumATK.

```python
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
from NL.Computer import *
from NL.Job import *
from NL.IO import *
atom_config = BulkConfiguration(
    bravais_lattice=FaceCenteredCubic(4.05 * Angstrom),
    elements=[Aluminum],
    fractional_coordinates=[(0, 0, 0)]
)
nonlocal_psp = ProjectorAugmentedWave(
    kinetic_energy_cutoff=75 * Hartree,
    electronic_temperature=300 * Kelvin
)
calculator = LCAOCalculator(pseudopotential=nonlocal_psp)
atom_config.setCalculator(calculator)
bulk_configuration = calculate(atom_config)
nlsave('Aluminum.py', bulk_configuration)
```

To run this QuantumATK python script one could use the following command line option:

```bash
atkpython MyScript.py
```

Here 'MyScript.py' is python script file which is used as the input file for QuantumATK.

The python script file requires the definition of the atomic configuration, pseudopotential, and calculator setup. The 'nlsave' method is used to save the results in the 'Aluminum.py' file.
This script runs an LCAO calculation on a bulk Aluminum system, and the output is saved in a file named "Aluminum.py".
