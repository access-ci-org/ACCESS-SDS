Use Case: Use torchvision for image and video processing in machine learning projects.

Code details and examples: Code

Torchvision is a python library and part of the PyTorch project. It consists of popular datasets, model architectures, and common image transformations for computer vision. Here is a simple example where torchvision is used for loading an image, pre-process it and run prediction using a pre-trained model.

```python
# required libraries
import torch
from torchvision import models, transforms
from PIL import Image

# Load the pre-trained model
model = models.densenet121(pretrained=True) 

# Image processing transformations
transform = transforms.Compose([
    transforms.Resize(256),
    transforms.CenterCrop(224),
    transforms.ToTensor(),
    transforms.Normalize(mean=[0.485, 0.456, 0.406], std=[0.229, 0.224, 0.225]),
])

# Load an image
img = Image.open("image.jpg")

# Pre-process the image
img_t = transform(img)

# Create a mini-batch as expected by the model
batch_t = torch.unsqueeze(img_t, 0)

# Set the model to evaluation mode
model.eval()

# Run the model on the pre-processed image
out = model(batch_t)

# Print the top 5 predicted labels
_, indices = torch.topk(out, 5)
percentage = torch.nn.functional.softmax(out, dim=1)[0] * 100
for idx in indices[0]:
    print(classes[idx], percentage[idx].item())
```

Here the input to the torchvision library is an image file, named image.jpg. The preprocessing involves resizing, cropping, tensor conversion, normalizing. This is followed by expanding dimensions of the image tensor to match the input dimension of the image net models, which the dense net model belongs to. After prediction, the top 5 indices with highest probabilities are printed as output.
