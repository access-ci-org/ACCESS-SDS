Use Case: DFTD4 is often used to perform dispersion-corrected density-functional theory calculations. It's an advanced method for estimating non-covalent interactions, which can be critical for understanding biomolecular structures, materials designs, and reaction mechanisms. DFT-D4 model can be used with any modern density functional (DF) or wave function method.

Code: 

For calculating dispersion corrections using DFTD4, first, you need a molecular structure file (e.g., xyz file). 

A typical xyz file may look like this:

```
3
water molecule
O       0.0000000000     0.0000000000     0.0000000000
H       0.0000000000     0.7408480950     0.5820949320
H       0.0000000000    -0.7408480950     0.5820949320
```

To run DFTD4, you have to execute the following command:

```dftd4 water.xyz```

Please note that the structure file (e.g., water.xyz) should be in the same directory where you execute this command.

This will return the D4 dispersion and atomic parameters for your molecule that can be included in subsequent DFT calculations using other software.
