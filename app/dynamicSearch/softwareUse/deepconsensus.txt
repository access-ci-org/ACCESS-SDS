Use Case: DeepConsensus is a deep learning-based method developed by Google DeepMind for predicting the sequence of a DNA molecule, from the raw electrical signals generated by Oxford Nanopore Technologies' MinION sequencing devices. It can transform raw electrical signals into a DNA sequence.

Code Details and Examples:

Code:

DeepConsensus reads data from a tfrecord file as input which contains the original signal and some additional information generated by the company. 

Below is an example of how you can generate tfrecord file from the raw signal. In this case, it is assumed that a file named `input.fa` exists, which contains the raw signal.

```python
from google.protobuf import text_format
from deepconsensus.protos import deepconsensus_pb2

# Create a DeepConsensusInput protocol buffer.
dc_input = deepconsensus_pb2.DeepConsensusInput()

# Set mandatory fields. 
dc_input.subread_id = 'read0'
dc_input.chromosome = 'chr1'
dc_input.start = 1000
dc_input.end = 2000
dc_input.strand = deepconsensus_pb2.Strand.FORWARD

# Set the signal into pb.
dc_input.subreads.extend([
  deepconsensus_pb2.Subread(
    signal='YourSignalGoesHere', 
    start=1000, 
    end=2000, 
    strand=deepconsensus_pb2.Strand.FORWARD
  )
])

# Write the protocol buffer to a file.
with open('input.fa', 'w') as f:
  f.write(str(dc_input))

print('Wrote', dc_input)
```

Now, you can run deepconsensus model with this input file using the command below:

```bash
deepconsensus --callable_tfrecord input.fa --output_tfrecord output.fa
```

Here, `callable_tfrecord` is the location of tfrecord input file and `output_tfrecord` is the location of output file. 

Note: This code snippet assumes that DeepConsensus is the command line tool which takes `callable_tfrecord` and `output_tfrecord` as arguments. It is possible that actual command-line tool name or arguments may be different considering the proprietary nature of this tool.
