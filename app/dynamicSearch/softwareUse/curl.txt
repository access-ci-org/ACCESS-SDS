Use Case: Use curl to send a GET request to a specific URL.

Code details and examples: Code

```bash
# Create a text file named 'example.txt'. This will be our sample input file.
echo "This is an example text file." > example.txt

# Use 'curl' to send a GET request to a specific URL and save the response to 'response.html'.
curl https://example.com -o response.html
```

Format required: The input is a command line argument that specifies the URL of the web page you want to get. The output is saved in a file given in the -o option.

Specifications and details in input files and command: An HTTP or HTTPS URL is expected as the input. The -o option tells curl to write the output to a file instead of stdout. If the server returns HTTP redirects (3xx status codes), curl will by default follow them.

Command to run it: It's a one-liner that you can run in your terminal.

Note: Replace 'https://example.com' with the actual URL you want to access. Also, make sure that you have the necessary permissions to read/write the files and that the URL is accessible.
