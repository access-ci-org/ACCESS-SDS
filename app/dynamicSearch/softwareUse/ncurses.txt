Use Case: ncurses is a programming library providing an API, allowing the programmer to write text-based user interfaces in a terminal-independent manner. It's primarily used for developing GUI-like interfaces on a text based console.

Code details and examples: 

A sample code snippet using ncurses library in C++ can be as shown below:

```C++
#include <ncurses.h>

int main() {
    initscr();           // Initialize the window
    printw("Hello World");  // Print Hello World
    refresh();           // Print it on to the real screen
    getch();             // Wait for user input
    endwin();            // End the window

    return 0;
}
```

The file required is a C++ file with .cpp extension, which includes the ncurses library.
This would just print "Hello World" to the console.

To compile and run this C++ ncurses program:

Compile:
```bash
g++ -o hello_world hello_world.cpp -lncurses
```
Here, `hello_world.cpp` is the input file.

Run:
```bash
./hello_world
```
