Use Case: Use r-nor1mix to fit univariate normal mixtures for a given dataset. 

Code details and examples: Code. 
For the r-nor1mix library, an R package, you might have input data structured in a CSV file with several columns where each column represents a different variable. Let's say you have a CSV file named "data.csv" has a column "Age" which you want to fit a univariate normal mixture.

Sample data file (data.csv):
```
ID,Age
1,25
2,24
3,27
4,23
5,30
6,28
7,29
```
Here is a sample code snippets that reads the data file, and fits univariate normal mixtures on "Age" using r-nor1mix library:

```R
# Required library
library(nor1mix)

# Read your data, here for instance a CSV file
data <- read.csv("data.csv")

# Fit the univariate normal mixtures
fit <- norMixEM(data$Age)

# Print the result
print(fit)
```
The command to run this R script (assume that it is saved as script.R) would be as follows:

```bash
Rscript script.R
```
