Use Case: Phred is commonly used in bioinformatics for base calling. It processes the output from DNA sequencers to predict the sequence of bases and their quality scores.

Code details and examples:

Input File: 
Phred requires a chromatogram file, standard formats being ABI or SCF format.

Code:
Phred does not directly take code input; it is operated via command line using command arguments to specify the details required. 

Sample command to run Phred:
```sh
phred -id . -sd . -qd . -trim_cutoff 0.05 -trim_fasta -trim_alt "" -trim_phd
```
In this command
- -id indicates the input directory.
- -sd specifies the directory to store the .seq and .qual files.
- -qd specifies the directory to store the .phd.1 files.
- -trim_cutoff 0.05 sets the trimming error probability cut-off.
- -trim_fasta generates FASTA files of the trimmed sequences.
- -trim_alt "" sets the name of alternate output file format.
- -trim_phd generates PHD files for the trimmed sequences. 

There's no standard input file, as it depends on the sequence being processed. However, it should be in either ABI or SCF format.

Note: actual usage may vary depending on the version and particular requirements. For all options and more information please refer to the manual/documentation provided with the software.
