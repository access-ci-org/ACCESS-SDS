Use Case: FastANI is used for fast whole-genome alignment to estimate the genetic distance (Average Nucleotide Identity, ANI) between closely related genomes. This is commonly used in microbial genomics to classify bacteria.

Code details and examples:

Code:
FastANI needs two input file lists which include paths for query and reference genomes respectively. These lists can be generated manually or using the 'find' command in Linux. Here is a sample command using FastANI:

```shell
# Generate file lists. For simplicity, we're assuming all genomes are in the same folder.
# Replace '/path/to/genomes' with the actual path where your genomes are stored.
find /path/to/genomes -name "*.fna" > genome_list.txt

# Run FastANI
fastANI -q genome_list.txt -r genome_list.txt -o output.txt
```

Input file:
FastANI works with genomic sequences in FASTA format (.fna, .fasta). Here is an example of what a sequence might look like in .fna format:

```
>sequence1
AGCTTTTCATTCTGACTGCAACGGGCAATATGTCTCTGTGTGGATTAAAAAAAGAGTGTCTGATAGCAGC
>sequence2
TTTTTTTCTGAGAGGTTAAGTGTAGAGCTACTCTGGAGCTACCACATCTTGACGGTACCAGCACGATGTCCACGAGTGCTTGACAC
...
```

Output file:
The output.txt file will contain the ANI values for each pair of genomes in your input list. The output looks like:
```
Genome1 Genome2 ANI_value matches total_fragments
```
