Use Case: "blob" is an R package used to represent BLOBs (Binary Large OBjects). It's frequently used in conjunction with DBI (Database Interface) package for reading and writing BLOBs to databases.

Code details and examples:

Code:

```R
# Load blob package
library(blob)

# Create a blob object with raw vector
b = blob::blob(list(as.raw(1:10)))

# Access the raw vectors
as.raw(b)
```

The input is a list of raw vectors (binary data), and a blob object is returned. This operation doesn't have a specific input file format as it works with in-memory binary data.

Command to run: just execute the R script either via an IDE like RStudio, R command line or using Rscript from the command line.
e.g. `Rscript script.R`
