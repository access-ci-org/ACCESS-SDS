Use Case: ORCA is a highly flexible, efficient and easy-to-use quantum chemistry program package. It is used for predicting molecular properties such as structure and molecular spectra. 

Code details and examples: 

Code: 

Consider the hypothetical file called "input.inp", which contains the following data:

```
! RHF 6-31G*

* xyz 0 1
O    0    0     0
H    0    0     0.9697
H    0.9697    0     0 
```

In this example, the "! RHF 6-31G*" line tells ORCA that you want to perform a calculation using the Restricted Hartree-Fock method with the 6-31G* basis set. The "* xyz 0 1" line is suggesting that the following lines represent a molecule's coordinates in the xyz format. The 0 and 1 indicate charge and multiplicity respectively.

To perform the calculation, you would use the command:

```bash
orca input.inp > output.out
```

This command implies you are running ORCA using the input file ("input.inp") and that you will save the output to "output.out". 

The output file, "output.out" will hold the results of your computation including structure, energy, and other computed properties. The actual results will vary based on the type of calculation and the options chosen in your input file.
