Use Case: Zarr is a python library for handling big numerical arrays larger than memory. It provides a compact, efficient binary format and it is useful, for instance, in multi-dimensional climate data and genomics data where the demand for larger arrays is common.

Code details and examples: In Python, Zarr library usage often includes different types of data manipulation. Here is an example of creating a 2D array and populating it with data:

Code:
```python
import numpy as np
import zarr

# Create a Zarr array
z = zarr.zeros((10000, 10000), chunks=(1000, 1000), dtype='i4')

# Now, we can treat `z` just like a NumPy array, and populate it with data.
z[:] = np.arange(100000000).reshape((10000, 10000))

# We can also read the data back:
out = z[0:1000, 0:1000]
```

Command to run: the Python file can be run from the command line like this: `python filename.py` where 'filename.py' is the name of your python script containing the above code. 

Input Files: It doesn't require any input file. All the necessary inputs are generated within the code script.

Format Required: Since this doesn't require an input file, there's no specific format required.

Specification and Details in Input Files: As no input file is used, there are no specifications to be met.
