Use Case: OpenBLAS is an optimized BLAS (Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms) library that can be used in numerical computing and mathematical software applications. It comes in handy for high-performance operations on vectors and matrices.

Code Details and Examples:

OpenBLAS does not need a separate input file but is often used alongside other programming languages such as C++, R, and Python for computations. Here is a simple example in C++ where OpenBLAS is used for matrix multiplication:

```cpp
#include<cblas.h>

void multiply_matrices() {
  
  double a[6] = {1.0,2.0,1.0,-3.0,4.0,-1.0};
  double b[6] = {1.0,2.0,1.0,-3.0,4.0,-1.0};
  double c[9] = {.5,.5,.5,.5,.5,.5,.5,.5,.5};

  cblas_dgemm(CblasColMajor, CblasNoTrans, CblasTrans,3,3,2,1,a, 3, b, 3,2,c,3);
}

int main()
{
    multiply_matrices();
    return 0;
}
```

No input files are needed for the OpenBLAS C library. The library provides functions for Various mathematical operations on Vector and Matrix.

To compile the code using OpenBLAS you could use the following command: 

```g++ -I /path/to/cblas/ -L /path/to/openblas/ -lopenblas your_file.cpp```

Where -I indicates the include directory (header files), -L indicates the library directory (OpenBLAS library), and -lopenblas is the library to link against. Replace /path/to/cblas/ and /path/to/openblas/ with the actual path where CBLAS and OpenBLAS are installed respectively.

Note: OpenBLAS doesn't interact with input files directly. It provides routines that can be called from higher-level programming languages. This example is displaying how to use OpenBLAS in a C++ program. Furthermore, using libraries like OpenBLAS often requires understanding of the linear algebra operations that you wish to perform.
