Use Case: Parallel computing of scalar products between two vectors.

Code details and examples: 

Code: 

The sprod program works with input files containing two vectors. The input file should be a text file containing numbers of a vector on each line. An example of an input file is:

```
3
4
5
6
7
```

This could represent two vectors: (3,4,5) and (6,7). 

To run the command you can use the following command:

```bash
$ sprod input_file.txt
```

This will calculate the scalar product between the two vectors in the input file. Output will be printed in the terminal. 

Please note that sprod works only with numerical input. If you provide other types of input, you will get unexpected results or errors. 

Here's a sample code snippet to represent the basic functionality of sprod:

```
# Include the necessary libraries
#include <stdio.h>
#include <mpi.h>

# Initialize MPI 
MPI_Init(NULL, NULL);

# Create MPI Communicator
MPI_Comm world = MPI_COMM_WORLD;
int world_size, my_rank;
MPI_Comm_size(world, &world_size);
MPI_Comm_rank(world, &my_rank);

# Define the vectors
# In reality, you will read these from the input file
int a[] = {3, 4, 5};
int b[] = {6, 7};

int sprod = 0;

# Calculate the scalar product
for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
  sprod += a[i] * b[i];
}

printf("Scalar product: %d\n", sprod);

# Finalize MPI 
MPI_Finalize();
```

This code initializes MPI, calculates the scalar product of two vectors and finally finalizes MPI. 

Please replace array values and their respective lengths according to your input data. In production, you will want to handle error conditions, edge cases and handle dynamic length vectors. 

Feel free to modify the provided sample code to handle dynamic vectors and adapt it to your needs.
