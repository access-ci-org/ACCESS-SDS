Use Case: Hypothesis testing in development and unit testing of software. Hypothesis (hypo for short) is a Python library for creating unit tests, which simplifies the process of creating complex data structures for testing your Python code. It works on the basis of property-based testing. 

Code Details and Examples:

Code:

```python
from hypothesis import given
import hypothesis.strategies as st

# that's how we define that our function should be tested with integers
@given(st.integers())
def test_negation(x):
    assert x == -(-x)
```

This script defines the function `test_negation` which will be tested with random integers. If the assertion `x == -(-x)` would not be true for any integer, then we say that this test has found a bug.

If no command is specified, Hypothesis will run the test with a wide range of random inputs. To run the tests, you typically put the tests in a file and run it using a testing command line tool such as pytest. 

Command to run:

`pytest filename.py` 

where filename.py is the Python file containing your Hypothesis tests.
