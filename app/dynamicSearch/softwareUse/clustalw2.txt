Use Case: ClustalW2 is a general purpose multiple sequence alignment program for DNA and proteins. It produces biologically meaningful multiple sequence alignments of divergent sequences.  

Code Details and Examples: 

Code: 
```
clustalw2 -INFILE=sequences.fasta -OUTFILE=aligned.fasta
```

Input file: The input file required for ClustalW2 is a FASTA format file that contains multiple sequences to be aligned.

Format Required: FASTA format. An example of the input file would be:
```
>Seq1
AGTCCGTAGCCTAGCG
>Seq2
GTTCCGTCGCCTACGG
>Seq3
TAGTCGTAGCTCAGCG
```

Specifications and Details in Input Files: Sequences should be represented in FASTA format, with each sequence starting with a '>' followed by the sequence's name, and the sequence itself in the following lines. Sequences can be of varying lengths.

Command to run: `clustalw2 -INFILE=sequences.fasta -OUTFILE=aligned.fasta`

This command will generate the output to a file named 'aligned.fasta'. The output file will be a multiple sequence alignment in which gaps are inserted into the sequences to optimize alignment.
