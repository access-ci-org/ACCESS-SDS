Use Case: Use Kcachegrind to visualize call graph and data flow in the parallel program to identify the bottleneck and optimize.

Code details and examples: Code.

1. To use Kcachegrind, we first need to create a callgrind file using valgrind tool.

Command-line to run your C program and create a callgrind file:
```bash
$ Valgrind --tool=callgrind ./my_program
```
This command produces a `callgrind.out.pid` file.

2. Open the generated callgrind file with Kcachegrind. 

Command-line to start Kcachegrind:
```bash
$ kcachegrind callgrind.out.pid
```

The `callgrind.out.pid` file can be a complex document and doesn't have a static format as it varies based on your source code. It basically contains a list of your function calls, the number of instructions executed in each call, and call tree (which functions call which ones).

The C program (`my_program`) in the commands stated above doesn't have a specific input format as it'll depend on your specific program. But an example of a C program that can be analyzed with Kcachegrind could be:

```C
#include <stdio.h>

void function1() {
    int i, num=0;
    for(i=0; i<10000; i++) {
        num += i;
    }
    printf("%d", num);
}

void function2() {
    int i, num=0;
    for(i=0; i<5000; i++) {
        num += i;
    }
    printf("%d", num);
}

int main() {
    function1();
    function2();
    return 0;
}
```

Save it as `my_program.c`. To run it using valgrind, you first need to compile your C program:

```bash
$ gcc my_program.c -o my_program
```
Now you can run with the valgrind command mentioned before.
