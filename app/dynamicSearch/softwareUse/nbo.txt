Use Case: NBO (Natural Bond Orbitals) is a program that provides insights into chemical bonding and molecular interactions. Users can glean details pertaining to hybridization, bond strengths, and intermolecular forces through the extensive analysis of electron density in molecules. 

The program is typically called from within another computational chemistry software package, such as Gaussian. 

Code Details and Examples: 

Code:

In the Gaussian input file (.gjf or .com extension), the following command line should be added:

```
# NBO
```
This lets the program know to utilize the NBO functionality.

A sample Gaussian input file that requests an NBO analysis would look like this:

```
%Chk=myfile.chk
#P B3LYP/6-31G(d) scf=tight geom=connectivity NBO

This example demonstrates how to perform a NBO analysis on a molecule with one carbon atom, four hydrogen atoms, and one oxygen atom. The structure of the molecule is specified through cartesian coordinates and then followed by a connectivity list detailing the bonds between atoms. 

To run the analysis, the (filename).gjf or (filename).com file is executed in Gaussian. If using a linux system the commandline command would be:

```
g16 < inputfile.gjf
```
