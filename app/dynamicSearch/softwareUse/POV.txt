Use Case: The Persistence of Vision Raytracer (POV) is a software package that generates images from a text-based scene description. It is used in fields such as graphic design, video games, film, animation, and other areas where realistic rendering is required.

Code Details And Examples:

Input file format: .pov/or .ini file

Specifications And Details In Input Files: 

Files for POV-Ray consist of scene description files - plain text files that contain all of the information for the objects, lighting, texturing, etc., necessary to render a three-dimensional scene.

Here is a simple example depicting a sphere on a checkerboard plane.

Input File:

```
#include "colors.inc"
background{White}
camera{location <0,0,-5> look_at 0}
light_source{<-10,10,-10> color White}
sphere{<0,0,0>,1 pigment{Red}}
plane{<0,1,0>,1 pigment{checker Silver,Gold}}
```
This .pov file creates a simple scene that includes a red sphere on a checkerboard plane, lit by a single white light source. The camera is located 5 units away from the centre of the scene and aimed at the origin.

Command to run it:

```povray +Iinput.pov +Ooutput.png +W1024 +H768 -D```

In this command, `+Iinput.pov` specifies the input file and `+Ooutput.png` specifies the output file plus its format. `+W1024 +H768` sets the image dimensions, while `-D` sets the mode to display the image while rendering.
