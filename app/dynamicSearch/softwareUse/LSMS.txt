Use Case: Use LSMS (Locally Self-consistent Multiple Scattering) for running large-scale electronic structure simulations based on density functional theory, especially designed for materials studies.

Code details and examples: Code

Sample Input File – LSMS:
To start with, create a file named `ctrl_lsms`.

Content example:

```
% const
  alat=7.50
  ecut=2.0
%

% set
  ngrid=1
  nx=1
  ny=1
  nz=2
%  

% include
  family=’alCu’
%

% set
  family = fcc001r10.inp
  evec = 0.2 0.1 0.3
%

% species
  z=13.  al=1. vtot=’al.vtotal’
  z=29.  cu=1. vtot=’cu.vtotal’
%

```

Command to run: 

LSMS runs on HPC systems using MPI. Assuming your executable is named "lsms", the command to run would look something like that:

`mpirun -np 32 lsms`

Where "-np 32" indicates the number of processor cores to be used. The actual command and number of cores would depend on the specific HPC environment and the size of the problem. 

Please make sure you have all your input files in the right directory before you run the command.
