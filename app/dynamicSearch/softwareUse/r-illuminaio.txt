Use Case: The R package illuminaio is used in bioinformatics for fast parsing of Illumina Microarray output files into basic formats like dataframe, list, etc. These parsed data can further be used in downstream analysis.

Code details and examples:

Code:

1. Parsing BGX Files into a dataframe:

```R
# Load library
library(illuminaio)

# Define the BGX file location
bgx_file <- "sample.bgx"

# Read the BGX file
bgx_df <- readBGX(bgx_file)

# View the first few rows
head(bgx_df)
```

Command to run: `Rscript bgx_parser.R`

In the above code, the `readBGX` function is used to parse the .bgx file and the result is stored in a dataframe named `bgx_df`. Input file here is the .bgx file and it can be any Illumina microarray output file. This BGX file needs to be in a specific format as generated by Illumina Microarray scanner. 

2. Reading IDAT Files:

```R
# Load library
library(illuminaio)

# Define IDAT file path
idat_file <- "example.idat"

# Read IDAT file
idat_data <- readIDAT(idat_file)

# Print the data
print(idat_data)

```

Command to run: `Rscript idat_reader.R`

The `readIDAT` function reads the idat file and stores the result in the `idat_data` variable. You would need to provide the path to your .idat file as input, in standard idat format created by Illumina platforms.

The parsed data can be used as input for downstream analysis such as normalization, differential expression, etc. within the R environment.
