Use Case: AlphaFold is used for predicting protein structure from sequence. It conditions an autoregressive model on evolutionary covariation through two feedforward neural networks.

Code details and examples: Code

Sample input format:

Running AlphaFold generally requires two files, a FASTA file and an MSA (Multiple Sequence Alignment) file.

The FASTA file should look like this:
```
>sequence
MENSDSNDKGSDQSAAQRRSQMDRLDREEAFYQFVNNLSEEDYRLMRDNNLLGTPGESTEEELLRMLSACQD
```

The MSA file should look like this (generated using a tool like HHblits or JackHMmer against a database like Uniref or BFD):
```
>sequence
MENSDSNDKGSDQSAAQRRSQMDRLDREEAFYQFVNNLSEEDYRLMRDNNLLGTPGESTEEELLRMLSACQD
```

Sample command line to run:

```
python run_alphafold.py --fasta_paths=my_fasta.fasta --msa_paths=my_msa.a3m --max_template_date=2020-05-14
```

This command tells alphafold to take in the sequences located in `my_fasta.fasta`, the corresponding MSAs located in `my_msa.a3m` and not to use any templates that were released after `2020-05-14`. Note that the `--max_template_date` argument is optional.
