Use Case: PAPI software, a.k.a Performance API, is used to access the hardware performance counters present in most modern microprocessors. It provides a consistent interface and methodology to collect performance counters information from the CPU. PAPI can be used to monitor the CPU cycles, instructions completed, cache misses, etc.

Code details and examples:

Code:

PAPI provides C, C++, and Fortran programming interfaces. Here is a simple C snippet to measure the number of Level 1 data cache misses:

```cpp
#include "papi.h"

#define NUM_EVENTS 1

int main()
{
    int Events[NUM_EVENTS] = { PAPI_L1_DCM };
    long long values[NUM_EVENTS];

    /* Start counting events */
    if (PAPI_start_counters(Events, NUM_EVENTS) != PAPI_OK)
    {
        printf("Error in PAPI_start_counters\n");
        return 1;
    }

   /* Run your code here which you want to measure */

    /* Stop counting events */
    if (PAPI_stop_counters(values, NUM_EVENTS) != PAPI_OK)
    {
        printf("Error in PAPI_stop_counters\n");
    }
    else
    {
        printf("Level 1 data cache misses: %lld\n", values[0]);
    }

    return 0;
}
```

This program will count the number of Level 1 data cache misses while running the code between the `PAPI_start_counters` and `PAPI_stop_counters` calls.

Command to run the code -

To compile: `gcc -o papi_example papi_example.c -lpapi`

To run: `./papi_example`

The output will show the number of Level 1 data cache misses that occurred while running the unspecified piece of code.
