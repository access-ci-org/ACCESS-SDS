Use Case: OpenMS is a software tool for LC/MS data management and analyses, which can handle data in mzML, mzData, mzXML, and several other formats.

Code Details and Examples:

Sample Input File:
A common file format for OpenMS is the mzML file format, which is a common data format in mass spectrometry. An mzML file might look like this:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?>
<mzML xmlns="http://psi.hupo.org/ms/mzml" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://psi.hupo.org/ms/mzml http://psidev.info/files/ms/mzML1.1.0.xsd" version="1.1.0" id="urn:lsid:psi.hupo.org:mzML.instanceDocuments.WIFF.dta2d" accession="MS:1000584">

  </run>
</mzML>
```

Code Snippets:

OpenMS provides a collection of command-line tools which can be used separately or chained together to perform complex analyses. Here's an example of how to use the "FeatureFinderMetabo" tool on an input mzML file:

```bash
FeatureFinderMetabo -in input.mzML -out output.featureXML
```

This command applies the FeatureFinderMetabo tool to identify features in the input data.

It should be noted that OpenMS also provides an API which can be used for custom analysis of mass spectrometry data. This API is written in C++, and documentation and examples can be found on the OpenMS website.
