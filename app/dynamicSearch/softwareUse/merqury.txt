Use Case: It is used to evaluate the quality of a genome assembly using k-mer spectra. 

Code Details and Examples: 

Code:

Firstly, the user must generate a k-mer counts table using meryl. Meryl is a k-mer counter that comes bundled with the Merqury tool. Let's suppose you have a reference genome (referred.fasta) and an assembly to evaluate (assembly.fasta). Here is a brief step-by-step guide on how to generate the required k-mer histogram files:

To get the k-mer counts for the reference genome:
```
meryl count k=21 [referred.fasta] output reference.meryl
```
To get the k-mer histogram for the reference genome:

```
meryl histogram reference.meryl > reference.hist
```
To evaluate the assembly quality using Merqury:
```
merqury reference.meryl assembly.fasta assembly_qc
```
This will create a myriad of output files, including assembly statistics, a VCF file of errors in the assembly, and various plots and histograms showing the k-mer composition of the assembly. When complete, check "assembly_qc.qc" for the final assessment stats and "assembly_qc.html" for the plots.
