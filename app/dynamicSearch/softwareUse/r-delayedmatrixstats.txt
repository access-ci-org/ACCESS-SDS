Use Case: The R-delayedmatrixstats software is used for calculations of summary statistics of DelayedArray objects along selected dimensions irrespective of the size of the objects.

Code details and examples:

Code:

```R
# Import the required library
library(DelayedMatrixStats)

# Create a Matrix
data_matrix <- DelayedArray(matrix(runif(10000), ncol = 10))

# Compute row sums
rowsum_results <- rowSums2(data_matrix)

# Compute column sums
columnsum_results <- colSums2(data_matrix)

# Show the results
print(rowsum_results)
print(columnsum_results)
```

Sample Input Files: Not applicable. The data matrix is generated within the code.

Format Required: Not applicable. The data matrix is generated within the code.

Any Specifications and details in Input Files: Not applicable.

Command to run: This is R code, which can be run in an R environment like RStudio. After inputting the code, press Ctrl+Enter to run it.

User should replace `runif(10000), ncol = 10` with their own data to get results applicable to their use case. Also, user should already have `DelayedMatrixStats` installed in their R environment to be able to run this code. The functions `rowSums2` and `colSums2` are used to calculate the sum of rows and columns of the DelayedArray respectively.
