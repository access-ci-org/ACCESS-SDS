Use Case: Proteinortho is used for orthology detection in a large set of complete genomes, such as comparison of transcriptomic, proteomic data with complete genomes. It is applicable to create and analyze phylogenomic data sets.

Code details and examples:

Code: 
The input files are fasta files with each entry being a protein/gene of a genome. Here is an example of a fasta file:

    >protein1
    ACGTACGTACGTACGT
    >protein2
    TTGACGTTGACGTTGA
    >protein3
    CGTACGTACGTACGTACG

Make sure every protein/gene has a unique identifier after the ">". Proteinortho then takes these fasta files as input:

    proteinortho5.pl genome1.fasta genome2.fasta genome3.fasta

This will produce two output files: orthologous groups (proteinortho-graph) and pairwise orthologs (proteinortho). Each line in the proteinortho-graph file starts with the group size (#:), followed by the group identifier (+:), and then entries of the format speciename:proteinname for each gene in the group. The pairwise orthologs file contains lines in the format speciename1 proteinname1 speciename2 proteinname2 score.

Note: Double check the headers in your fasta files. Headers in FASTA format start with a '>'. The character '|' is often used as a separator. The Proteinortho manual advises users to format their headers like this:
'>speciesname|proteinname' or '>speciesname|geneid|proteinname', where 'speciesname' is a functional identifier unique to the species set.

Please ensure that you have the suitable computational requirements as performing orthology analysis on large data sets can be a memory-intensive task.
