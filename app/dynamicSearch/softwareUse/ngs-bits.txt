Use Case: 
Use ngs-bits for quality control, variant calling, and variant annotation for Next-generation sequencing data.

Code details and examples:

Code:

1. Sample input file: Say we have a Fastq file as an input.
   File Format: Fastq file (genomic reads)
   Filename: sample1.fq

2. Command to convert Fastq to Bam:
   `Fastq2Bam -in sample1.fq -out sample1.bam`
   
   This generates a Bam file from Fastq file.

3. Command to perform Quality Control:
   `BamQC -in sample1.bam -out qc_short.html`

   This generates a quality control (QC) report in HTML format.

4. Command to perform Variant Calling:
   `BamToFastq -in sample1.bam -out sample1.fq`

   This generates a Fastq file from the Bam file, to perform variant calling subsequently.

5. Command to perform Variant annotation:
   `VariantAnnotate -in variant.vcf -out variant_annotated.vcf`

   This generates an annotated variant file from the variant call format (vcf) file.

Note: The commands and usage heavily depend on the actual data files and tools available.
