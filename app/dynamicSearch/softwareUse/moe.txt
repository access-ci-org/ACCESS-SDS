Use Case: The MOE (Molecular Operating Environment) is a software system designed for Computational Chemistry, Molecular Modeling, Bioinformatics, Virtual Screening, Structure-Based-Design and Homology Modelling. It is routinely used to predict properties such as solubility and logD for small molecules.

Code:
Below is a theoretical example of running a MMFF94 energy minimization on a benzene molecule using MOE:

```
/*************************************************
* MOE main program 
* MMFF94 energy minimization of benzene in gas phase
* 
* Created:  January 1, 2022
**************************************************/
//create a benzene molecule
c := Chain[];
r := Residue[c,'UNL'];
Atom[r,'C',[-1.2094,0.6993,0.0000]];
Atom[r,'C',[-0.0000,1.3986,0.0000]];
Atom[r,'C',[1.2094,0.6993,0.0000]];
Atom[r,'C',[1.2094,-0.6993,0.0000]];
Atom[r,'C',[-0.0000,-1.3986,0.0000]];
Atom[r,'C',[-1.2094,-0.6993,0.0000]];
Atom[r,'H',[-2.1476,1.2433,0.0000]];
Atom[r,'H',[-0.0000,2.4866,0.0000]];
Atom[r,'H',[2.1476,1.2433,0.0000]];
Atom[r,'H',[2.1476,-1.2433,0.0000]];
Atom[r,'H',[-0.0000,-2.4866,0.0000]];
Atom[r,'H',[-2.1476,-1.2433,0.0000]];

$bdisplay_chains={c};

//run an MMFF94 energy minimization
e := MOE_minimize[':-mmff.partial'][];
writeln['Output energy: ', e];
```

Command to execute the script in MOE:

Assuming the script is saved as script.svl, you would run it from the command line with

``` moebatch -exec script.svl ```

Please note that this script only works in the MOE software, it will not work in a regular python or c++ interpreter as MOE has its own scripting language (svl).
