Use Case: The GROMACS Optimized Bio-molecular Force Field (GOBFF) is typically used in molecular dynamics simulations to gain insights into the behavior and interactions of molecules.

Code details and examples: Code

Input file format:
The input to GOBFF mainly requires two files: equil.mdp and topology.top.

The equil.mdp file outlines the details of the simulation such as the temperature control method, the type of ensemble, and the duration of the simulation.
An example of equil.mdp is as follows:

; RUN CONTROL PARAMETERS
integrator               = md 
tinit                    = 0 
dt                       = 0.002
nsteps                   = 500000
nstcomm                  = 1
nstxout                  = 5000
nstvout                  = 5000
nstfout                  = 0
nstlog                   = 5000
nstenergy                = 5000
nstxout-compressed       = 5000
; FORCE PARAMETER
cutoff-scheme            = Verlet
ns-type                  = grid
nstlist                  = 10
rcoulomb                 = 1.0
rvdw                     = 1.0
...

The topology.top file outlines the molecular structure and the force field parameters.
An example of topology.top is as follows:

Command to run it:
First, you need to pre-process your input files. This is done with the command:
```
gmx grompp -f equil.mdp -c system.gro -p topology.top -o system.tpr
```
Then, the simulation is run with:
```
gmx mdrun -v -deffnm system
```
