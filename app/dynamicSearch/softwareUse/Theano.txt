Use Case: Theano is a Python library that allows you to define, optimize, and evaluate mathematical expressions involving multi-dimensional arrays efficiently. It is particularly well-suited for large computational loads such as those found in deep learning.

Code details and examples:

Code:
To use Theano, it's necessary to define the variables and expressions weâ€™ll use. For simple mathematical expressions, this seems overkill.

Firstly, we import theano:
```python
import theano
from theano import tensor
```
Then we define the variables. In Theano, we define variables using `theano.tensor` sorts of objects. The variable declarations are a little different than normal Python symbolic computations. Instead of giving a value to a variable directly in the computation, we allow Theano to automatically fill-in the needed variable.

```python
# declare two symbolic floating-point scalars
a = tensor.dscalar()
b = tensor.dscalar()
```
A function `f` that computes the sum of `a` and `b`:

```python
# create a simple expression
c = a + b

# convert the expression into a callable object that takes (a,b)
# values as input and computes a value for c
f = theano.function([a,b], c)

# bind 1.5 to 'a', 2.5 to 'b', and evaluate 'c'
result = f(1.5, 2.5)
print(result)
```
When you run this code, the output displayed will be `4.0`.

Command to Run:
Since Theano is a Python library, you just need to run your Python code as usual. For example, if your code is in a file named `example.py`, you can run it using this command:

```bash
python example.py
```
