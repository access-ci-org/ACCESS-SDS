Use Case: Xorg Server is a public, open-source implementation of the X Window System. It provides the basic framework for a GUI environment: drawing and moving windows on the screen and interacting with a mouse and keyboard. 

Code details and examples:

For Xorg, usually no explicit input files are needed as many settings are automagically discovered at runtime. However, a configuration file can be used to set various parameters. This file is typically named xorg.conf and located at /etc/X11/ or /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/.

Contents of a Sample xorg.conf file:

```
Section "Device"
 Identifier "Videocard0"
 Driver "vesa"
EndSection

Section "Monitor"
 Identifier "Monitor0"
 HorizSync 30.0 - 70.0
 VertRefresh 50.0 - 160.0
 Option "DPMS"
EndSection

Section "Screen"
 Identifier "Screen0"
 Device "Videocard0"
 Monitor "Monitor0"
 DefaultDepth 24
 SubSection "Display"
 Depth 24
 Modes "1024x768"
 EndSubSection
EndSection
```

To run xorg, it is usually started with a display manager like GDM or manually with the `startx` command. To specify a config file:

`Xorg -config /etc/X11/xorg.conf`
