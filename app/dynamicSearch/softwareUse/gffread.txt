Use Case: Use gffread to extract sequences from a FASTA file covered by features in a GFF file, useful in bioinformatics for transcriptome analysis. The sample input would include a GFF file (which includes annotations like gene name, start, end, etc.) and a corresponding FASTA file.

Code details and examples: Code.

Sample input files:

1. sequences.fasta: 

```
>seq0
ACTGACTGACTGACTGACTGACTGACTG
>seq1
ACTGACTGACTGACTGACTGACTG
```

2. annotations.gff:

```
seq0   .   gene    1   26  .   +   .   ID=gene0;Name=gene0
seq0   .   mRNA    1   26  .   +   .   ID=transcript0;Parent=gene0
seq0   .   exon    1   26  .   +   .   ID=exon0;Parent=transcript0
seq1   .   gene    1   25  .   +   .   ID=gene1;Name=gene1
seq1   .   mRNA    1   25  .   +   .   ID=transcript1;Parent=gene1
seq1   .   exon    1   25  .   +   .   ID=exon1;Parent=transcript1
```

Command to run:

```
gffread annotations.gff -g sequences.fasta -w output.fasta
```

This command reads the annotated regions from the GFF file 'annotations.gff', extracts these from the FASTA file 'sequences.fasta', and writes them to 'output.fasta'.
