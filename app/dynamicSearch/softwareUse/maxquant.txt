Use Case: MaxQuant is a software package used for proteomics data analysis. It's primarily designed to analyze large mass spectrometric data sets. 

Code details and examples:

Code: 

MaxQuant is not typically run through a code script but through an interactive user interface. However, it does accept input files, the main ones being the raw files of mass spectrometry data.

Format required: 

MaxQuant accepts a range of file formats but the most common ones are .RAW files (outputted from Thermo Fisher's mass spectrometers).

Specifications and details in input files: 

The .RAW files contain the raw data from the mass spectrometer, including the masses and charges of the detected ions. In addition, a fasta file with the sequence database against which the data is searched is needed. 

Command to run: 

As noted above, MaxQuant is generally run through a user interface rather than a command line. A typical use case would involve:

1. Open MaxQuant

2. Provide the directory for the .RAW files

3. Specify the fasta file 

4. Configure other parameters as desired (e.g. variable modifications, fixed modifications, enzyme specificity)

5. Click "Start" to run the analysis

Note: MaxQuant does have a command line version, but the use is quite complex and typically not used in a day-to-day analysis.
