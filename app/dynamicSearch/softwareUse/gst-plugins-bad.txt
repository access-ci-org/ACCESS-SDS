Use Case: 
gst-plugins-bad is used for playing a variety of multimedia formats that are not supported by the base GStreamer system. They are plugins for GStreamer that aren't up to par quality-wise, or more complex than the good ones. It has a collection of output, codec and filter plugins e.g. plays (decodes) audio from a variety of formats such as mp3, WAV, OGG, FLAC, etc.

Code details and examples: 

Code:
```bash
gst-launch-1.0 filesrc location=/path/to/audio/file ! decodebin ! autoaudiosink
```
The input for GStreamer is usually a media file, in this case, an audio file. It uses the decodebin plugin to decode the audio from various formats, and autoaudiosink to direct the output to an appropriate system audio sink (output, such as speakers).

For a video example, the following is a simple pipeline that plays a video file:
```bash
gst-launch-1.0 filesrc location=/path/to/video/file ! decodebin ! autovideosink
```
In the case of a video file, autovideosink is used to direct the video output to an appropriate system video sink (output, such as a display or window). The autovideosink will try to use the best sink available.

gst-plugins-bad does not provide explicit information about input file specifications. It is meant to handle a broad range of multimedia formats, but the quality or full functionality of these plugins may not be guaranteed. It's recommended to use files adhering to popular digital multimedia formats such as mp3, ogg, wav for audio, and mp4, avi, mkv for video.
