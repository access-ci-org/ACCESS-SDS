Use Case: help2man is a tool that automatically generates simple man pages from program output. It is used when the software doesn't have a manual page.

Code Details and Examples: 

help2man is typically used in a command-line environment. Here are some examples of how you might use it:

* Generate a man page for the gcc program:
```
help2man gcc -N --name="the GNU compiler collection" -o gcc.1
```
In this example, `-N` means to not include a "SEE ALSO" section in the man page, `--name` provides a description for the program, and `-o` specifies the output file.

* Generate a man page including information from the `--help` and `--version` options:
```
help2man --include=help.txt --version-string=1.0 myprogram -o myprogram.1
```
In this case, `--include` specifies a file containing text to include in the man page, such as responses from `--help`, and `--version-string` provides a version for the program.

Input Files: help2man reads output from running the program with `--help` and `--version` options.

File Formats: The output file is a text file written in the roff language, which is used for creating man pages.

Note that there's no need for a sample input file, as help2man creates its output based on the built-in `--help` and `--version` options of the program it's documenting.
