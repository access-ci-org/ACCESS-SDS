Use Case: LTRpred is a software package used for predicting the presence of LTR retrotransposons in genomic sequences. It performs a series of bioinformatics analyses to predict and annotate these elements. LTRpred requires input in the form of a genomic sequence in FASTA format.

Code details and examples:
Code: 

Input file: The input is a FASTA file containing the genomic sequence. The format is as such:

>sequence_identifier  
ATGC ...

For example:
>fgenesh1_pg.C_scaffold_1000003  
ATGCGTACTAGCGTACGATCGTAGCTAGCTACGTAGCTACGTAGCTCG

Running LTRpred code:

#### Load LTRpred package in R
```r 
library(LTRpred)
```

#### Use of LTRpred function with sample input
```r 
LTRpred(genome.file = "genome.fasta", 
        outdir = "~/ltrpred_out",
        copy.number = TRUE, 
        clust = FALSE)
``` 

In this example, "genome.fasta" is the genome sequence in FASTA format. The 'outdir' is the output directory in which the results will be saved. 'copy.number' is used to calculate the copy number of each LTR retrotransposon. 'clust' enables or disables clustering of the results. 

Please note that for actual use, you have to substitute the "genome.fasta" with the path to your actual genome sequence file and "~/ltrpred_out" with your desired output directory. Please also consider environment's resources since LTRpred could be resource-consuming depending on genome size and server capabilities.
