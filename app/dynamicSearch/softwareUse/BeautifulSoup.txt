Use Case: BeautifulSoup is a Python library for pulling data out of HTML and XML files. It provides a few simple methods and Pythonic idioms for navigating, searching, and modifying a parse tree.

Code Example:

Here is a simple example to illustrate the use of BeautifulSoup. The example shows how to parse an HTML document and extract the text contents of all `p` (paragraph) tags:

```python
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

html_doc = """
<html><head><title>Welcome to my website</title></head>
<body>
<p class="title"><b>Your way to success</b></p>

<p class="story">There once was a little man, who had a big dream...</p>

<p class="story">...</p>
"""

soup = BeautifulSoup(html_doc, 'html.parser')

# Print out the text contents of all 'p' tags
for p in soup.find_all('p'):
    print(p.get_text())
```

This will output:

```
Your way to success
There once was a little man, who had a big dream...
...
```

Input File Details: BeautifulSoup parses HTML and XML documents. The documents can be loaded from a file, or passed directly as a string (as in the example above). If you're loading the document from a file, it should be a regular text file with HTML/XML markup.

Command to run: If the above code is saved in a Python script (e.g., `parse_html.py`), it can be executed from the command line like so:
```
python parse_html.py
```
