Use Case: Atropos is used for adapter removal and quality trimming in high-throughput sequencing data. This tool can help in cleans up reads and removes any adapter sequences, N bases, and low-quality reads for producing high-quality reads.

Code details and examples:

Code: 

Atropos takes as input a set of sequence reads and a set of adapter sequences. The adapter sequences need to be provided in a FASTA format.

Sample Input File: 

Reads:
FASTQ format file (can be in Gzipped form)
```
@SEQ_ID
GATTTGGGGTTCAAAGCAGTATCGATCAAATAGTAAATCCATTTGTTCAACTCACAGTTT
+
!''*((((***+))%%%++)(%%%%).1***-+*''))**55CCF>>>>>>CCCCCCC65
```

Adapter sequences: 
```
>Prefix/1 
TACACTCTTTCCCTACACGACGCTCTTCCGATCT
```
The output of Atropos will be the reads that have been trimmed. 

Command to run Atropos:

- Simple command-line execution for single-end reads:

```bash
atropos -a ADAPTER_FWD -se reads.fq.gz > trimmed_reads.fq.gz
```

- For paired-end reads, use the -A flag to specify the reverse complement of the 3' adapter for the second read in the pair.

```bash
atropos -a ADAPTER_FWD -A ADAPTER_REV --op1 trimmed1.fq.gz --op2 trimmed2.fq.gz -se reads1.fq.gz reads2.fq.gz
``` 

where ADAPTER_FWD is the sequence of the adapter that was ligated to the 3' end of the read (or the reverse complement of the 5' adapter), and ADAPTER_REV is the reverse complement of the adapter that was ligated to the 5' end of the second read in a pair (or equivalently, the 3' adapter on the second read). 

Note: 'atropos' command is case-sensitive. It must be lower-case. Output files are in FASTQ format (can also be Gzipped). There is no specific limitation in the input files except that they should be in the proper format (FASTQ/FASTA) for reads and adapter files. Improper formatting may cause errors in the execution.
