Use Case: RstudioDesktop is an open-source IDE for R, providing user-friendly interface to work with R. Common use case for scientists is to perform data analysis and visualization.

Code details and examples:

Code:
We will be using an example of data analysis where the `mtcars` dataset is used.
```r
# Load the dataset
data(mtcars)

# Calculate the mean of mpg (Miles per gallon)
mean(mpg)

# Perform a linear regression where mpg is dependent on cyl (Number of cylinders)
outcome <- lm(mpg ~ cyl, data = mtcars)

# Get a summary of the regression model
summary(outcome)
```

Input: 
The `mtcars` dataset is a built-in dataset in R, it's loaded into the environment using `data(mtcars)`
