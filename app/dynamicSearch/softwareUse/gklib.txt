Use Case: gklib, a library of high-level functions for C and Fortran programs, is widely used for data analysis and scientific computing tasks such as matrix operations, memory management, and data structures. It is important for the input files to be in the correct format for this library to function. However, no specific input file format is required as gklib functions operate on loaded data in your program.

Code details and examples: 

Input data varies based on the particular function being used. For instance, when doing matrix operations like multiplication, your input might be two array structures representing matrices.

Example - Vector addition:

```
#include "GKlib.h"

int main() {
  gk_csr_t *matA, *matB, *matC;

  /* Assume matA and matB are allocated and initialized matrices */
  
  /* Perform matrix addition operation */
  matC = gk_csr_Add(matA, matB);
  
  /* Use matC */
  
  /* Deallocate matrices when done */
  gk_csr_Free(&matA);
  gk_csr_Free(&matB);
  gk_csr_Free(&matC);

  return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}
```

Command to run:

Assuming the file is named `main.c`,
Compile: `gcc -o main main.c -lgklib`
Run: `./main` 

Again, the specifics will depend on what exactly you're trying to do, as the library is versatile and its functions have various different inputs and outputs.
