Use Case: This file command-type can be used for storing and operating on data in a structured way. It is common with SQL databases. For this example, we are using SQLite database.

Code details and examples: 

Code:
Firstly, to interact with a '.db' file using Python3, one needs to use the sqlite3 module.

```python
import sqlite3
# Connect to SQLite database
conn = sqlite3.connect('example.db')

# Create a cursor object
c = conn.cursor()

# Execute a SQL command
c.execute("CREATE TABLE stocks (date text, trans text, symbol text, qty real, price real)")

# Insert a row of data
c.execute("INSERT INTO stocks VALUES ('2006-01-05','BUY','RHAT',100,35.14)")

# Save (commit) the changes
conn.commit()

# Close the connection
conn.close()
```
In this simple demonstration, a SQLite database file called example.db is being manipulated using Python's sqlite3 module. A table called "stocks" is created with five columns: date, trans, symbol, qty, and price. After which a single row of data is inserted into the table.

Command to date:

`python3 script.py`

Note: dbname.db is a SQLite database file.
