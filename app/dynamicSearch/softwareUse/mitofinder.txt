Use Case: Mitofinder is a program used in bioinformatics to reconstruct and annotate mitochondrial genomes directly from raw sequence data.

Code details and examples: 

Code: 

Mitochondrial genome reconstruction command:

```
Mitofinder -1 input_R1.fq -2 input_R2.fq -r reference.fasta -o output_directory -n organism_name
```

Here's the example of input sequence data in FastQ format (input_R1.fq):

```
@SEQ_ID
GATTTGGGGTTCAAAGCAGTATCGATCAAATAGTAAATCCATTTGTTCAACTCACAGTTT
+
!''*((((***+))%%%++)(%%%%).1***-+*''))**55CCF>>>>>>CCCCCCC65
```

Where `@SEQ_ID` is the unique identifier for the sequence, the second line is the sequence itself, the "+" symbol is the separator, and the last line is the quality score of the sequencing.

The reference genom (reference.fasta) format is:

```
>sequence_1
ATCGATCGATCGATCGAT
>sequence_2
ATCGATCGATCGATCGAT
```

Where `>sequence_1` and `>sequence_2` are the unique identifiers for each sequence and the following lines are the sequences themselves.

The program will automatically generate a directory with the specified output_directory name, which will contain the reconstructed and annotated mitochondrial genome. The name of the organism is specified with `-n`.
