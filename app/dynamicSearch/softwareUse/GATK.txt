Use Case: Genomic Analysis Toolkit

GATK (Genome Analysis Toolkit) is a software package developed at the Broad Institute that allows researchers to analyze high-throughput genomic sequencing data. GATK includes several tools, for things like SNP calling, indel calling, and multiple types of analysis on genetic variation data surrounding the calls. 

Code details and examples:

Two primary input files for GATK are a reference genome file, usually a FASTA file, and a sequence mapping file, usually in BAM or SAM format. 

1) Reference genome file (FASTA format)
The reference genome file should contain the DNA sequences for chromosomes or any other large genomic regions. It typically looks like:

```
>chr1
NNNNNNNNNNNNTAGCTATCGATCGNNNNNN...
>chr2
NNNNNNNNNNNNGTCAGCTCGATCGNNNNNN...
```

2) Sequence mapping file (BAM/SAM format)
The sequence mapping files contain read sequences aligned to the reference genome. It typically looks like:

```
@SQ SN:chr1 LN:249250621
@SQ SN:chr2 LN:243199373
READ_1 163 chr1 10000 39 76M = 10076 -31 TTTTAAGGATATATTTAGGTTAGATAGGGTTTAGATAGAGTGAATTGGATTAATTTGGAGGA
```

Code example for a variant discovery in a single sample:

```
java -jar /path/to/gatk.jar HaplotypeCaller \
    -R /path/to/reference/reference.fasta \
    -I /path/to/sample/sample.bam \
    -O /path/to/output/output.vcf
```

This command instructs GATK to run the HaplotypeCaller tool, taking the specified reference file '-R' and the input sample file '-I'. The output, a VCF file containing the predicted genomic variants, is specified with '-O'. Different tools within the GATK suite may require additional parameters or files to be specified. 

Note: The path to java, gatk.jar, the reference genome, the bam file, and the output vcf all need to be specified correctly for the script to run. Java must be installed.
