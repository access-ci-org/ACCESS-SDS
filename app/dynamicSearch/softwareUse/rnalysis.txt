Use Case: RNA-seq data analysis using the rnaSeqMap library in R; the purpose is to create a gene expression map from RNA-seq reads files and align them to the genomic map. 

Code details and examples: 

Required Input File: 
1. A gene annotation file in GFF3 or GTF format; 
2. .bam or .sam files containing the sequence reads. 

Sample Input File:
1. Annotation file might look something like this:
```
##gff-version 3
#!gff-spec-version 1.21
#!processor NCBI annotwriter
#!genome-build GRCh37.p13
#!genome-build-accession NCBI_Assembly:GCA_000001405.14
#!annotation-date 13 March 2014
#!annotation-source Homo sapiens Annotation Release 104
chr1 HAVANA  gene    11869   14409   .   +   .   ID=gene0;Name=DDX11L1;biotype=lincRNA
chr1 HAVANA  transcript  11869   14409   .   +   .   ID=transcript0;Parent=gene0;Name=DDX11L1-002;biotype=lincRNA
```
2. .bam file, it is a binary format file, so it can't be read and displayed straightforwardly.

Here are the command steps you may consider in R:

- Load the package 
```R
library(rnaSeqMap)
```

- Import your organism and the base genome:
```R
genome <- seqInfo(BSgenome.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg19)
```

- Load and process the .bam file:
```R
bamFilenames <- c("yourBamFile.bam")
reads <- dba(sampleSheet=bamFilenames)
```

- Load the GTF/GFF file:
```R
gtfFilenames <- c("yourGTFFile.gtf")
annot <- importGFF3(gtfFilenames)
```

- Map the reads to the genes:
```R
mappedReads <- exonsByGene(reads)
```

- Generate a count matrix:
```R
counts <- countOverlaps(mappedReads)
```

The use of the commands depends on the specific details and requirements of the RNA-seq analysis. Different analyses might need different approaches. Users should refer to the rnaSeqMap package manual for more details and customization.
