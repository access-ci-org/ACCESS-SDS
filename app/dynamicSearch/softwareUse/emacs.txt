Use Case: Emacs is a powerful, customizable, self-documenting text editor â€“ and more where you can combine different 'modes' to edit any kind of text. It could be used for programming, scripting, markup languages, notes, blogging, to-do lists and agenda, Typesetting documents, and more. 

Code details and examples: 

Code:

Emacs doesn't run commands or scripts in the same way as a shell terminal. It provides an interactive buffer where you can type in commands and see results. 

For example, to open a file you can use the command:

```
C-x C-f filename RET
```

In this command, 'C' stands for the control key, 'x' and 'f' are the alphabetic keys and 'RET' is the return or enter key. The command 'C-x C-f' invokes the 'find-file' command, which then prompts for a filename. 

To save a file, you'll use the command:

```
C-x C-s
```

Command to run(read and print) python code in Emacs:

Emacs has an interactive Python mode which looks like this:

```
M-x python-mode
```

To run a python script in emacs:

```
M-x run-python
```
Then move to the script and press C-c C-c to send the buffer to Python.

You can also write lisp code directly into the minibuffer (the command line at the bottom of the Emacs window), by starting a line with the command `M-:` which stands for `eval-expression`.

```
M-: (insert "Hello, emacs")
```

This will immediately insert the text "Hello, emacs" at the point in the current buffer.
