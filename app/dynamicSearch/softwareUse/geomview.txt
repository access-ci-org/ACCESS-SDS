Use Case: Geomview is a geometric visualization software which allows users to display 3D objects and scenes in a variety of formats (OFF, DXF, etc.) interactively. It can be used in a variety of fields but it is especially useful for mathematical visualization.

Code details and examples:

Code:

Given a sample OFF (Object File Format) input file, named "cube.off", which represents a cube:

OFF
8 12 6
0 0 0
0 1 0
1 1 0
1 0 0
0 0 1
0 1 1
1 1 1
1 0 1
4 0 1 5 4
4 1 2 6 5
4 2 3 7 6
4 3 0 4 7
4 4 5 6 7
4 0 3 2 1

The OFF file begins with OFF followed by a line containing the number of vertices, faces, and edges. Then, there are 8 lines, each describing the x, y, z coordinates of a vertex, followed by 12 lines describing each face and which vertices compose it.

To display this 3D object using Geomview, run this command in the terminal:

geomview cube.off

This will open up the Geomview GUI, where the cube can be viewed and interacted with in 3D.
