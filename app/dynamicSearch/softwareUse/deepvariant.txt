Use Case: DeepVariant is a tool developed by Google Brain Team for the purpose of germline variant calling, i.e., identifying mutations in an individual's genome by comparing it with a reference genome. It uses a deep learning approach to identify genetic variants from high-throughput sequencing data.

Code details and examples:

Code:

deepvariant is usually called from the command line in the following format:

```
 ./opt/deepvariant/bin/run_deepvariant \
   --model_type=WGS \
   --ref=/path/to/reference.fasta\
   --reads=/path/to/aligned_reads.bam \
   --output_vcf=/path/to/output.vcf.gz \
   --output_gvcf=/path/to/output.g.vcf.gz
   --regions chr20 \
   --num_shards=10
```

In this command:
- `--model_type` is set to `WGS` indicating Whole Genome Sequencing. You can also set it to `WES` for Whole Exome Sequencing or `PACBIO` for Pacific Biosciences data.
- `--ref` denotes the path to the reference genome sequence in FASTA format.
- `--reads` indicates the path to your aligned reads in BAM format.
- `--output_vcf` and `--output_gvcf` specifies the path to output variant call files in VCF and gVCF formats respectively.
- `--regions` is an optional parameter that can be used to limit variant calling to specific chromosomal regions.
- `--num_shards` specifies the number of shards to use in parallel processing.

Sample input files required by DeepVariant:

1. Reference genome in FASTA format, typically denoted `reference.fasta`.

2. Aligned reads in BAM format `aligned_reads.bam` file. The BAM file should be aligned to the reference genome and sorted by coordinate.

These input files should conform to the respective standards for FASTA and BAM files.

No additional specifications in the input files are required beyond what is standard for FASTA and BAM files. Proper care should be taken to ensure that the BAM file is correctly sorted and indexed, and that the FASTA file is properly formatted with correct headers. DeepVariant does not handle malformed input files gracefully.
