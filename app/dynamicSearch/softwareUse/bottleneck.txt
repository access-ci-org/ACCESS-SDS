Use Case: Bottleneck is a Python library used for statistical and array computation. It accelerates NumPy and Pandas. A simple use case is calculating the moving average of a list of numbers.

Code details and examples:
File Input: N/A;
Format Required: N/A;
Specifications: N/A;

Code Snippet:

```python
import numpy as np
import bottleneck as bn
data = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, np.nan, 7, 8])
print(bn.move_mean(data, window=3, min_count=1))
```

Command to run:

```bash
python filename.py
```

The above command will run the filename.py file in Python and display the moving average of the array. Insert your file name at the filename place.
