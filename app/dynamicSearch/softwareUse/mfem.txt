Use Case: MFEM is a free, lightweight, scalable C++ library for finite element methods that provides high-order mathematical models to solve partial differential equations (PDE) from several areas of computational science and engineering.

Code Details and Examples: 

MFEM supports a variety of mesh formats including the flexible MFEM mesh format, suitable for 2D and 3D meshes. Here is a sample mesh file with 6 vertices and 3 elements:

```

1.0 1.0   
0.0 2.0 
```

This file defines a 2D mesh with three quadrilateral elements. The first section specifies the mesh's spatial dimension (2D or 3D). This is followed by the elements section, wherein each row specifies a different element. Here, '3' is the number of points defining each element (3 for 2D), and the following numbers are the indices of vertices in the vertices section. The vertices section specifies the coordinates of each vertex.

You can read and visualize this mesh file using the MFEM example 1:

Code: `./ex1 -m sample.mesh`

Where 'sample.mesh' is the name of your mesh file. The program will solve the Laplace problem with Dirichlet boundary conditions on the given mesh.
