Use Case: scvelo is a scalable toolkit for estimating and analyzing cell velocities in single-cell RNA sequencing data using RNA velocity. Scvelo is used to extract the dynamical structure underlying the static snap-shot of cell-to-cell variability. It computes RNA velocities of spliced/unspliced abundances based on your input dataset.

Code details and examples: 

Input File Format: An AnnData object with spliced/unspliced abundances labeled as 'spliced' and 'unspliced'. 

Code:

```python
import scvelo as scv
import numpy as np

# Load dataset
adata = scv.datasets.pancreas()
adata.layers["spliced"] = np.random.beta(2, 2, adata.shape)
adata.layers["unspliced"] = np.random.beta(2, 2, adata.shape)

# Preprocess data
scv.pp.filter_and_normalize(adata, min_shared_counts=20, n_top_genes=2000)
scv.pp.moments(adata, n_pcs=30, n_neighbors=30)

# Perform calculations
scv.tl.velocity(adata)
scv.tl.velocity_graph(adata)

# Plot results 
scv.pl.velocity_embedding_stream(adata, basis='UMAP')
```
Command to run: N/A as this is a Python library, it is called and used within Python scripts.
