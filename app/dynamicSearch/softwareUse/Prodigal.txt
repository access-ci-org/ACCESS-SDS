Use Case: Prodigal is typically used for gene prediction in bacteria, archaes, and metagenomes. It predicts genes based on finding potential open reading frames and using a sophisticated algorithm to analyze protein-coding potentials.

Input Files Format:
Prodigal requires a fasta file as input. The command needs to have Prodigal followed by:
 
- -i to specify input filename 
- -o to specify output filename 
- -a to specify protein sequence output filename (optional)
- -p to specify the procedure (single or metagenomic) (optional)

```
prodigal -i input.fna -o output.txt -a output.faa -p single
```

The input file could be an assembled genome and the format of the file should be as follows:
 
```
>sequence_1
ATG CTGAAA...
>sequence_2
ATG VCGGT...
```

Here, sequence_1, sequence2, ... indicates names of sequences and these are followed by DNA sequences (ATG CTGAAA...). 

Output Files:
The output file contains the gene sequences (in fasta format) while another output file output.txt contains the location of genes on contigs.
