Use Case: Bracken is a bioinformatics software that is used for estimating species abundances in DNA sequences. It is commonly used in metagenomics analyses to determine the composition of bacterial, viral, or other microbial communities in a sample. 

Code details and examples: Code

```python
# To execute bracken, you need a Kraken report file and a Bracken directory.
# An example command is provided below:
bracken -d /path/to/database -i sample.kraken -o sample.braken -r 100 -l S -t 10

# Here's what the command does:
# -d LEADS TO THE DATABASE: This is the directory to the Kraken database that was used for the initial Kraken run. 
# -i INPUTFILENAME: This is the Kraken report generated by Kraken which will be used by Bracken. 
# -o OUTPUTFILENAME: The output file that Bracken generates. 
# -r READLENGTH: The length of the reads on which Kraken was run 
# -l LEVEL: The taxonomy level at which to assign reads (Options are S(species), G(genus), etc.)
# -t THRESHOLD: The minimum number of reads required to classify a species as present.

# Sample content of the Kraken report (sample.kraken) to be input to Bracken
# This file can be generated with the command: kraken-report --db /path/to/db sample.kraken > sample.kraken.report
C   45556   45556   45556   Root
C   45551   45551   45551   cell
C   45551   45551   45551   Bacteria
```

To run the command, you would enter it in a command line terminal such as bash. The result would be an abundance estimate written to the output file specified. Remember to replace the '/path/to/database' with the actual path to your database, and similarly for other file paths. The command assumes you have the Bracken and Kraken tools installed on your system. 

WARNING: Running bioinformatics tools can require considerable computational resources, such as CPU and RAM. It is recommended to run these tools on a high-performance computing cluster or a sufficiently powerful workstation.
