Use Case: Use HDF5 to create a file and a group in it, and to write a dataset with complex data into that group. HDF5 operates with hierarchical data formats suitable for storing large amounts of numerical data. It is widely used in scientific computing.

Code details and examples: Code

HDF5 files get created in C using the HDF5 library. Here's an example of how to create an HDF5 file:

```C
#include "hdf5.h"
#define FILE "file.h5"
int main() {
   hid_t       file, dataset, dataspace;  /* handles */
   herr_t      status;
   hsize_t     dimsf[1];              /* dataset dimensions */
   double     data[10];
   int         rank = 1;

   file = H5Fcreate(FILE, H5F_ACC_TRUNC, H5P_DEFAULT, H5P_DEFAULT);

   /* Initialize data. */
   for (int i = 0; i< 10; i++) {
        data[i] = i + 0.1;
    }

   dimsf[0] = 10;
   dataspace = H5Screate_simple(rank, dimsf, NULL);
   dataset = H5Dcreate(file, "/Dataset", H5T_IEEE_F64LE, dataspace, H5P_DEFAULT, H5P_DEFAULT, H5P_DEFAULT);
   status = H5Dwrite(dataset, H5T_NATIVE_DOUBLE, H5S_ALL, H5S_ALL, H5P_DEFAULT, data);

   H5Sclose(dataspace);
   H5Dclose(dataset);
   H5Fclose(file);

   return 0;
}
```
The code first includes the required HDF5 library. It then defines a file path and initializes a main function. Inside the main function, handles for the file, the dataspace, and the dataset are initialized. A status variable is also initialized to catch HDF5 return codes. A rank and array of doubles are then declared and populated with data. 

A file is then created using H5Fcreate. Inside the file, a dataspace and a dataset are created. The data is written to the dataset, and finally, the dataspace and dataset are closed. The command to compile this code is:

```Bash
gcc hdf5example.c -o hdf5example -lhdf5
```
And to run it:
```Bash
./hdf5example
```
File input format: The input files are created by the script itself, so there are no predefined input files. The output file will be in .h5 format.

Specifications and details in the input files: There are no input data files as the example is creating its own data to fill into the dataset. 

This was a basic example. HDF5 is capable of handling much more complex use cases with various data types.
