Use Case: Reading a DICOM file and printing metadata information; generating an image from the DICOM file.

Code details and examples:

Code
```python
# Import Required Libraries
import pydicom
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load DICOM File
dcm = pydicom.dcmread("path_to_dicom_file.dcm")

# Print Metadata Information
print(dcm)

# Generate Image from DICOM
plt.imshow(dcm.pixel_array, cmap=plt.cm.bone)
```
This script uses the `pydicom` library to read in a DICOM file, which is a binary file format used to store medical imaging data.

The `dcmread` function takes a file path as input and creates a `FileDataset` object (stored in the variable `dcm` here), which contains the pixel data and metadata of the DICOM file.

The `FileDataset` object can then be interacted with like a dictionary to access certain metadata fields.

Finally, the `imshow` function from the matplotlib library is used to display the pixel data in the `FileDataset` object. The pixel data is accessed via the `pixel_array` property of the `FileDataset` object, and the colormap is set to mimic the appearance of bone.

The input file required is a DICOM file. To run this script, you would run `python3 script.py` in your command line, where `script.py` is the file containing the above python script.
