Use Case: Simulating and optimizing the performance of nanophotonic components, circuits and systems. 

Code Details and Examples:

Code:

Lumerical includes several products such as DEVICE Suite, SYSTEM Suite and INTERCONNECT. Each product uses its own input format but mostly they use Lumericalâ€™s proprietary scripting language which is similar to Python. Here is an example of a simple Lumerical DEVICE code that simulates a pn junction diode:

```
# Create new project
newproject;
anisotropicmaterial("Si");
set("index", 3.5);
set("index:z", 0);
set("conductivity", 0.3676);
set("Semiconductor", "N");
set("Donor Concentration", 1e16);
set("preferred mesh step x", 2e-7);

addrect;
set("name", "N-type");
set("x", 0);
set("x span", 5e-05);
set("y span", 2e-05);
set("z span", 2e-05);
set("material", "Si");

setnamed('N-type','x',-0.25e-3);
setnamed('N-type','x span',0.5e-3);
`copy(0,0.5e-3);

setnamed('N-type_1','doping type','P');
setnamed('N-type_1','Doping Concentration',1e18);
```

This script is dividing a P-N junction diode into two regions (N-doped and P-doped) with different donor and acceptor concentrations, and then we run the simulation.

Command to Run:

Run this script from the Lumerical DEVICE command line interface (CLI) with:

`lumerical-device-script my_script.lsf`
