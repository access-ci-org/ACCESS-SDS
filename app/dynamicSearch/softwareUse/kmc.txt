Use Case: KMC is a software designed for counting k-mers (subsequences of length k, derived from sequencing reads) from reads. It can count k-mers from standard FASTQ files. It's particularly useful in genomics and bioinformatics for sequence analysis.

Code details and examples:

Code: 

Input File: FASTQ file
Input File Format: Standard FASTQ format 

Sample Input File:
```
@SEQ_ID
GATTTGGGGTTCAAAGCAGTATCGATCAAATAGTAAATCCATTTGTTCAACTCACAGTTT
+
!''*((((***+))%%%++)(%%%%).1***-+*''))**55CCF>>>>>>CCCCCCC65
```

Command to run KMC:

```
kmc -k27 -ci1 -cs10000 -cx20000 input.fastq output_kmc kmc_tmp
```

Here,

- `kmc` is the main program,
- `-k27` defines the k-mer length. Here, 27.
- `-ci1` sets the minimal count of k-mers to put in the output file. Here, 1.
- `-cs10000` sets the maximal value of a counter. Here, 10000.
- `-cx20000` sets the maximal count of k-mers to put in the output file. Here, 20000.
- `input.fastq` is the input file.
- `output_kmc` is the output file.
- `kmc_tmp` is the temporary directory for computations.


Note: The command and flags might differ based on the version of KMC.
