Use Case: Use OpenLDAP for accessing and managing directory services in a networked environment.

Code:

The input file for OpenLDAP could be an LDIF(LDAP Data Interchange Format) file, which provides a way of expressing entries in a directory that complies with the LDAP standards.  Here is a sample of how an LDIF file could look:

```
dn: uid=john,dc=example,dc=com
objectclass: top
objectclass: person
objectclass: organizationalPerson
objectclass: inetOrgPerson
uid: john
cn: John Doe
sn: Doe
mail: john@example.com
userPassword: {CLEARTEXT}password
```

This file describes a directory entry for a person with the common name (cn) "John Doe", surname (sn) "Doe", email (mail) "john@example.com", and user id (uid) "john". The password is "password".

You can import this LDIF file into your OpenLDAP server with the following command:

```bash
ldapadd -x -D "cn=admin,dc=example,dc=com" -W -f myfile.ldif
```

Here -D specifies the binddn to bind to the LDAP directory with. -W prompts for the binddn's password.  -f specifies the input LDIF file.

You could also use the ldapsearch command to retrieve directory entries. Here's an example command which retrieves all entries with the surname "Doe":

```bash
ldapsearch -x -LLL -H ldap:/// -b dc=example,dc=com "(sn=Doe)" cn mail
```

Here -b specifies the base dn to search from. (sn=Doe) is the LDAP search filter specifying that the surname should be "Doe".  The final arguments "cn mail" specify that the common name and mail attribute should be returned in the results.
