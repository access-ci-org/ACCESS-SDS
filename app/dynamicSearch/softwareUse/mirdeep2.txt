Use Case: mirDeep2 is widely used in bioinformatics for discovering novel and known miRNAs from deep sequencing data. It can be used to determine the expressional changes and RNA editing events in miRNAs. 

Code details and examples: 

1. Input files: 
   - Small RNA reads in the FASTQ format 
   - A genome of interest in FASTA format 
   - Known mature miRNA in FASTA format 
   - Known hairpin miRNA in FASTA format 

2. Code: 

    Here is an example command for running the mirDeep2 tool:

    ```
    mapper.pl reads.fastq -e -h -j -m -l 18 -p bowtie_index -s reads_collapsed.fa -t arf.txt -v

    miRDeep2.pl reads_collapsed.fa genome.fa arf.txt mature.fa hairpin.fa -t Species -v > report.log 2>error.log
    ```

In the above example:

i) The first command is used to map the deep sequencing reads to the genome (let's say `bowtie_index` here is the index files of the genome which can be generated by bowtie-build command with genome.fasta).

ii) The `-s` option generates output file (`reads_collapsed.fa`) which are the reads that were processed and modified by miRDeep2. The `-t` option generates output file (`arf.txt`) which contains the read and genome alignments. 

iii) The second command is the main command line to run miRDeep2. It uses the processed reads (i.e., `reads_collapsed.fa`) and their alignments against the genome (i.e., `arf.txt`). Then, it uses known mature (i.e., `mature.fa` ) miRNAs and hairpin structures (i.e., `hairpin.fa`) of the miRNAs. The `-t` option specifies the species. The output is saved into `report.log` and any errors are logged into `error.log`.
