Use Case: CEGMA (Core Eukaryotic Genes Mapping Approach) is a pipeline for building a set of highly conserved genes from genomic data. It is normally used as a completeness test for genome projects.

Code details and examples:

Code: 

Input files: 

1. Genome Sequence file: It should be in FASTA format. Each sequence in the file is treated as a separate genome. 

Code Snippet Example:

cegma -g genome.fa

(Here, genome.fa is the genome sequence file.)

Command:

To run CEGMA, you simply use the following command, supplying the genome file as argument:

$ cegma -g <genome_file>

Here <genome_file> is a FASTA formatted file containing your assembled sequences. You can reference multiple assemblies by separating each file name with a comma.

For example, running CEGMA on a single genome could look like this:

$ cegma -g my_assembly.fa

To run CEGMA on multiple genomes at once could look like this:

$ cegma -g my_assembly1.fa,my_assembly2.fa,my_assembly3.fa

Note: CEGMA is a compute intensive process and may take several hours or even days to run, depending on the size and complexity of your genome.
