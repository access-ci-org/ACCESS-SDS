Use Case: ABPOA is a software package used for multiple sequence alignment, which is crucial in computational biology to identify evolutionarily related proteins or genes and to predict the function of uncharacterized proteins. 

Code details and examples:
 
Code:

The required input file format for ABPOA is FASTA. For example, a simple input file in FASTA format:

```
>Sequence1
ATGCGTACGTACGTACG
>Sequence2
ATGCGTACGTAGTACG
```

A sample command-line execution of ABPOA is as follows:

```bash
./abpoa -r1 seqs.fa >seqs.msa.fa
```

In above command, `./abpoa` calls the executable file for ABPOA, `-r1` represents to output MSA in consensus order and `seqs.fa` is the input file which contains unaligned sequences in FASTA format. The output after running this command is sent to `seqs.msa.fa`, which contains aligned sequences also in FASTA format.

Any specifications and details in input files:

- ABPOA implementation needs raw unaligned sequences as input in FASTA format. The first line of each sequence begins with '>' followed by the name/identifier of the sequence. The following lines contain the sequence of nucleotides or amino acids.
- Each sequence must be presented on a new line following its identifier.
- Blank lines are not allowed, neither within sequences nor between them. 
- Lowercase and uppercase letters are accepted, and will be treated as the same.
