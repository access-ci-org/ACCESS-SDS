Use Case: The bitops package in R is used for bitwise operations. This package makes it possible to operate on bits within (large) vectors of integers or doubles. It is very useful in performing data manipulation and mathematical operations on binary data.

Code details and examples:

Code: We can use the bitAnd function to perform a bitwise 'and' operation on two integers. For instance, the binary representation of 12 is '1100' and that of 9 is '1001'. The bitwise 'and' operation of 12 and 9 would result in '1000'. Hence, the result would be 8 in decimal system.

```R
install.packages("bitops")
library(bitops)

bitAnd(12, 9)
```
Input: Integer values for which bitwise operations need to be performed. In the above example, '12' and '9' are the inputs.

Output: Result of the bitwise operation. In this case, '8' is the output.

File Format Required: No specific file format is required for using this package. You can directly input your values into the function.

Command to Run: The above given R code can be run using the command `Rscript bitops_example.R` if the code is saved in a file named 'bitops_example.R'. If you are directly running this in R console, you can just hit enter after writing the code. 

Specifications and Details: No specific specifications are needed for the input values. However, if you are inputting negative integers or non-integer values, you may not get the desired result. The inputs should be positive integers.

Note: The 'install.packages("bitops")' command is not needed if the package is already installed.
