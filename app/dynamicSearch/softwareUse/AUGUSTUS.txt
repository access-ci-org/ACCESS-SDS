Use Case: AUGUSTUS is a bioinformatics software for predicting genes in eukaryotic genomes. 

Code Details and Examples: 

Code:

An example of how you might use AUGUSTUS is by providing it with a sequence file, specifying the organism. In its simplest form, the command might look something like this:

```
augustus --species=SPECIES FASTA_FILE
```

In this example, replace "SPECIES" with the name of the organism's gene you're predicting (for instance 'human') and "FASTA_FILE" with the path to a fasta file containing your sequence (for instance, 'sequence.fasta').

Here's a sample input file in FASTA format:

``` 
>seq1
AGTCCGTCTACAAGAGTACACGAGCTACGTAGCTACTGAGCTAGTCGATCGATCGT
```

You would then save it in a file named 'sequence.fasta' or similar and run a command like the one provided above. 

Furthermore, the species parameter can be included in a config file. Suppose 'config.txt' is a config file which includes the line: 

´´´ 
species = human
´´´ 

Then, the command would look like this: 

``` 
augustus config.txt 
``` 

If the sequence file is 'sequence.fasta', it should be mentioned in the config.txt file:

´´´ 
genome = sequence.fasta 
´´´ 

Then, it is enough to run: 

``` 
augustus config.txt
``` 

The output will print the predicted gene structures for each sequence included in your FASTA file. If you want to save this output to a file, you can redirect it using the '>' character, like this:

``` 
augustus --species=SPECIES FASTA_FILE > OUTPUT_FILE
``` 

Where "OUTPUT_FILE" is the path to the file where you want to save the output (for instance, 'predictions.txt').
