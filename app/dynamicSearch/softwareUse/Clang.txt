Use Case: Use Clang (a compiler front end for the programming languages C, C++, and Objective-C). It uses LLVM as its back end and has been part of the LLVM release cycle since LLVM 2.6.

Code details and examples: Code

A simple input file (hello.c) could look like this:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("Hello, world!\n");
    return 0;
}
```

Format Required: The file should be a valid C file (usually .c extension) with valid C code.

Specifications and Details: Clang essentially needs a C, C++, or Objective-C source file to compile.

The command to compile this file could be:

```bash
clang hello.c -o hello
```

This tells Clang to compile the source file 'hello.c' and output the executable to a file named 'hello'.

You can then run the compiled program using the following command:

```bash
./hello
``` 

which should output: 

```bash
Hello, world!
```
