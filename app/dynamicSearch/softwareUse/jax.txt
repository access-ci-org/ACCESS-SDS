Use Case: Differentiable Machine Learning research. 

Jax is a Python library for high-performance numerical computing. It is built on XLA (Accelerated Linear Algebra) which is a high-performance linear algebra compiler from Google. Jax allows operations on its array-like objects to be just-in-time (JIT) compiled into highly optimized XLA code. 

Models and computations in Jax can be run on either CPU, GPUs, or TPUs without code changes. Jax's ability to take derivatives, gradients, and even higher order gradients of functions (automatic differentiation) is essential for many machine learning algorithms, especially in deep learning where backpropagation is one of the key computations. 

1-D array of length 10, filled with zeros

Code details and examples: 

Code:

```python
import jax.numpy as jnp

x = jnp.zeros(10)
print(x)
```

Jax provides two main tools:

1. jit, for speeding up your code. It stands for “just-in-time compilation”. 

Finding square of the elements of a 1D array

Code:

```python
from jax import jit

square = jit(lambda x: x ** 2)

x = jnp.arange(10)

print(square(x))
```

2. grad, for taking derivatives. Using the same code, we get the derivative of a function.

Code:

```python
from jax import grad

derivative_of_square = grad(lambda x: x ** 2)

x = 3.0

print(derivative_of_square(x))  # Evaluates to 6.0
```

To run the above python codes, simply write the code in a python file and use the command `python filename.py` from the command line, or use an interactive Python environment like Jupyter notebooks.
