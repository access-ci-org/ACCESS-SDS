Use Case: Training a model to perform multi-label classification using fast.ai library.

Code details and examples: 

Code:

Firstly, you have to import the necessary libraries:

```python
from fastai.vision.all import *
```

Let's imagine we have a CSV file that contains two columns: 'id' and 'labels'. The 'id' column contains the name of the image file, and the 'labels' column contains the labels associated with the image, separated by a space.

Sample Dataset Input structure:

| id  | labels      |
|-----|------------|
| 1   | cat dog    |
| 2   | bird cat   |
| 3   | dog bird   |

Next, let's load the images and the labels from the CSV file:

```python
df = pd.read_csv('data.csv')

def get_x(r): return path/'images'/r['id']
def get_y(r): return r['labels'].split(' ')

rand_img = df.sample()
print(rand_img)

block = DataBlock(blocks=(ImageBlock, MultiCategoryBlock),
   get_x = get_x, 
   get_y = get_y)

dls = block.dataloaders(df)
```

Build and train the model:

```python
learn = cnn_learner(dls, resnet50, metrics=partial(accuracy_multi, thresh=0.2))

learn.fine_tune(3, base_lr=3e-3, freeze_epochs=4)
```

Finally, let's predict the labels for a new image:

```python
learn.predict('new_image.jpg')
``` 

To run this Python program, you would enter this in the command line:

```
python3 your_script_name.py
```

Please replace 'your_script_name.py' with the name of the Python script file that contains your code.
