Use Case: sourmash is a command-line tool and Python library for computing MinHash signatures from DNA sequences, comparing them to each other, and plotting the results. This makes it possible to do large-scale pairwise comparisons of metagenome, genome, and transcriptome data.

Code Details and Examples:

Code:

Before using sourmash, the signature of the sequence data needs to compute by using the `compute` command. 

```
sourmash compute *.fasta
``` 

The input file for this command is fasta and sourmash will create a `.sig` file for each input file. 

The compare operation can be done on those `.sig` files:

``` 
sourmash compare *.sig -o comparison 
```

Then the comparison matrix can be plotted with the `plot` command: 

```
sourmash plot comparison
```

This will generate a `comparison.matrix.png` file, a heatmap that visually shows the comparison result. 

You could also search for similar sequences in the databases, using the `search` command:

```
sourmash search sequence.sig -k 21 --dna --best-only
```

Using this command it will output the best matching sequences to the `sequence.sig` in the current local database. '-k 21' specifies the kmer size and '--dna' to limit to DNA signatures.
