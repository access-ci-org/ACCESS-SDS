Use Case: CP2K is a quantum chemistry and solid state physics software package that can perform atomistic simulations of solid state, liquid, molecular, periodic, material, crystal, and biological systems. CP2K provides a general framework for different modeling methods such as DFT using the mixed Gaussian and plane waves approaches GPW and GAPW. Supported elements include s, p, d, f, g functions up to angular momentum, methods like HF, MP2, RPA, semi-empirical methods, and potentiaLS.

Input File: Let's say we have a CP2K input file named "test.inp". The file format is divided into sections (denoted by &SECTION), keywords and values. An example input file could look like this:

```
&FORCE_EVAL
  METHOD Quickstep
  &DFT
    BASIS_SET_FILE_NAME BASIS_MOLOPT
    POTENTIAL_FILE_NAME GTH_POTENTIALS
    &QS
      EPS_DEFAULT 1.0E-10
      METHOD GPW
    &END QS
    &SCF
      SCF_GUESS ATOMIC 
      EPS_SCF 1.0E-7
      MAX_SCF 300
    &END SCF
  &END DFT
  &SUBSYS
    &CELL
      ABC 12.418 12.418 12.418
    &END CELL
    &COORD
      C 0.000000  0.000000  0.000000
      O 1.159076  1.159076  1.159076
    &END COORD
  &END SUBSYS
&END FORCE_EVAL
```

This file provides input configuration to calculate force evaluation for a CO molecule, using DFT with GPW method and SCF electronic structure method.

Command to run it: Assuming you have CP2K installed correctly, you could run this example at the terminal by inputting: `cp2k.popt test.inp > output.log` 

The output will be logged into the file output.log.
