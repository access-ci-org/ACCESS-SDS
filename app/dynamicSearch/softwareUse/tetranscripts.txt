Use Case: Tetranuscripts is a software package designed to estimate the abundances of a set of transcripts given multi-mapped RNA-Seq reads. It's commonly used in the analysis of transcriptome data.

Code details and examples: Code

1. Prepare the input file. 

An example of the input file (input.bam) obtained from RNA-Seq reads. This BAM formatted file should be sorted and contain aligned sequences to the reference genome.

2. Specify the reference genome and gene annotation files

The reference genome file (reference.fa) includes genome sequence information in FASTA format. The gene annotation file (annotation.gtf) includes information in GTF/GFF format.

3. Run Tetranuscripts

Command to run them:

`Tetranuscripts --bam input.bam --ref reference.fa --gtf annotation.gtf --out output_name`

The software will then estimate the abundances of transcripts and save the results in the specified output file.
