Use Case: 
The `withr` package is used in R to run code 'with' a modified global state. This is helpful for managing resources like options, par() or connection based files.

Code details and examples:

Code: 

```R
# loading the library
library(withr)

# setting a temporary global option
with_options(list(raster.options(maxmemory = 1e+09)), 
{
  # code here that requires a higher raster memory limit
})

# resetting the global option to its default state 
raster::rasterOptions(maxmemory = .Machine$integer.max)

# executing a command with a temporarily modified working directory
with_dir(tempdir(), getwd())
```

The code above first loads the `withr` library, then sets a temporary global option for increasing the raster memory limit. After the code block is executed, the global option is reset to its original value. The last piece of code executes a command while temporarily changing the working directory. 

The `with_options` function modifies the global option for the duration of the given code block, while the `with_dir` function changes the working directory temporarily when executing the specified command.

The required input format for `withr` commands is typically a list of parameters to modify, followed by a code block that relies on these modified parameters. 

To run these snippets at the command line you would use the Rscript command followed by the path to your R file. Such as:
```bash
Rscript /path/to/your/script.R
```

In the case of the withr package, there are no specifications or special details needed in the input files. The only requirement is that the parameters passed to the `withr` functions need to be applicable to the subsequent code block.
