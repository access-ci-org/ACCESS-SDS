Use Case: Binutils is a collection of binary tools that are primarily used for creating and debugging binary programs. The tools in the packages have different roles from handling binary object files to relocating and linking. 

Code details and examples: Code 

1. **objdump** - It is a command-line program for displaying various information about object files.

Example: 
	Run the command below to get a disassemble output of an ELF file.
	Command: `objdump -d /path/to/binary`
	
	Input: Binary file
	Format required: ELF, PE, COFF, a.out, ar (archive), Intel hex, or S-records.
	Specifications: No specific instruction for input files, just feed it the binary
	
2. **as** - The GNU assembler 
   
Example: 
    	Write Hello World assembly program
   
   	```
   	section .data
   	hello db 'Hello, World!', 0   ; Null terminated string to output
   	len equ $ - hello              ; Length of the string 

   	section .text
   	global _start

   	_start:
    	mov eax, 4                    ; syscall number (sys_write)
    	mov ebx, 1                    ; file descriptor (stdout)
    	mov ecx, hello                ; pointer to message to write
    	mov edx, len                  ; message length
    	int 0x80                      ; call kernel

    	mov eax, 1                    ; syscall number (sys_exit)
    	xor ebx, ebx                  ; exit code
    	int 0x80                      ; call kernel
  	```
	Now, compile and link it with as and ld respectively.
	Command: `as -o hello.o hello.s ; ld -o hello hello.o`
	
	Input: Assembly code (.s or .asm)
	Format required: x86 Assembly
	Specifications in input: Program written in Assembly language. 

3. **ld** - The GNU linker 

Example: 
   	The command below links a translated hello world object code into an executable. 
   	Command: `ld -o hello hello.o`
   
   	Input: Translated object code from assembly (.o)
   	Format required: Object Code
   	Specifications: Non-specific, .o files from as can be used.

4. **ar** - a Unix archiving program

Example: 
   	The command below creates an archive file from two object files.
   	Command: `ar rcs lib.a file1.o file2.o`
		
	Input: Object files
	Format required: Object file format or any readable format
	Specifications: Non-specific, as long as it can read the file it can archive it.
