Use Case: Pillow is a Python Imaging Library which supports opening, manipulating, and saving a wide variety of image file formats. It is useful in scenarios such as cropping an image, resizing the image, drawing on an image, image transformation, and other image processing needs. 

Code Details and Examples: 

Input Files: A sample input file is a .jpg image file, named "example.jpg". 

File Format: JPEG (.jpeg or .jpg), though Pillow supports numerous other image formats such as BMP, PNG, PPM, TIFF, and GIF, etc. 

Specifications/Details in Input Files: The input file is an image file. 

Code Snippet: 

```python
from PIL import Image 

# Open an image file
img = Image.open('example.jpg') 

# Resize the image
img.thumbnail((90, 90)) 

# Save the resized image
img.save('example_resized.jpg') 
```

Command to Run: Using a Python interpreter, run the Python script file where the above code is written. For example, if the code is written in a file named `main.py`, you would run `python main.py` from the command line or terminal. 

This code will open the image file 'example.jpg', resize the image to 90x90 pixels, and save the resized image as 'example_resized.jpg'. It is important to note that the image file should be located in the same directory where the python script is running, or a full path to the image file can be specified.
