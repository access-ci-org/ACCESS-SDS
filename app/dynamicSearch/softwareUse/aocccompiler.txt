Use Case: Compiler tools

Code details and examples:
```
The AOCC compiler (AMD Optimizing C/C++ Compiler) is based on LLVM and is designed to provide optimized performance for AMD processors. Below is an example of compiling a C program using the AOCC compiler.

Sample C program (example.c):
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("Hello, World!\n");
    return 0;
}
```

Compiling the C program with AOCC:
```
aocc example.c -o example
```

Running the compiled program:
```
./example
```
