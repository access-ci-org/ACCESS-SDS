Use Case: Cryptography is a Python library that is used for cryptographic recipes and primitives. It provides secure cryptographic functionality such as encryption, hashing, message authentication codes, key derivation functions, and cryptographic signatures.

Code details and examples:

Code:

```python
from cryptography.fernet import Fernet
# key generation
key = Fernet.generate_key()
cipher_suite = Fernet(key)
# conversion of plain text into bytes
data = "my data".encode()
cipher_text = cipher_suite.encrypt(data)
plain_text = cipher_suite.decrypt(cipher_text)
```

Input file: This python code does not need any input file. It takes a string "my data" as an input directly in the code.

Format required: The input is of type string in this example and it gets converted into bytes before encryption.

Specifications and details in input files: There is no input file in this code.

Command to run:

```
python your_file_name.py
```

I assume this code would be contained in a script you would run from your terminal. Make sure you replace your_file_name with the name of the file where you have copied the code.
