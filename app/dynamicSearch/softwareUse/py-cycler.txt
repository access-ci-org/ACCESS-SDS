Use Case: Cycling through colors and styles in data visualizations in Python.

Code Details and Examples: PyCycler is a Python package useful for creating iterators that cycle through different items in a list, such as colors or line styles. This is commonly used for plotting routines that require cycling over a set of properties.

Sample input:
```python
# Define a list of colors to cycle through
colors = ['b', 'g', 'r', 'c', 'm', 'y', 'k']

# Instantiate the cycler object
from cycler import cycler
col_cycler = cycler(color=colors)

# Iterate through the cycler
for item in col_cycler:
    print(item)
```

Output:
```python
{'color': 'b'}
{'color': 'g'}
{'color': 'r'}
{'color': 'c'}
{'color': 'm'}
{'color': 'y'}
{'color': 'k'}
```

Command to run it:
This is a python script, that can be saved as .py file and run using python from command line like this:
```bash
python3 your_script.py
```

Specifications and Details:
Input format is a list of items to cycle through, for this example a list of colors is used. PyCycler then cycles through these colors when iterated over. This can be useful for changing the color of a plot in a loop, for example.
