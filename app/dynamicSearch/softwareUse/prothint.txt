Use Case: ProtHint is a bioinformatics software used for gene prediction in foreign genomes. Typically, it's input files are multi-FASTA files of genomic sequences, and protein sequence data from related organisms.

Code details and examples:
Code:

Here, we'll examine an example of predicting genes in the E. coli K12 genome using protein data from the Pseudomonas fluorescence genome.

Your genome data may be in the file `echoli.fasta` and the protein sequence data in the file `pfluorescens.fasta`. 

```shell
prothint.py --threads 8 echoli.fasta pfluorescens.fasta
```

This command will initiate the ProtHint pipeline on eight threads using your input files. 

The main output file is `prothints.gff`, which contains the locations of all predicted genes. Other output files contain various intermediate results.

Input file format:

1. echoli.fasta - This file should contain the E. coli K12 genomic sequence in FASTA format. The beginning of the file might look like this:

```fasta
>Echoli
AGCTTTTCATTCTGACTGCAACGGGCAATATGTCTCTGTGTGGAT...
```

2. pfluorescens.fasta - This file should contain the Pseudomonas fluorescence protein sequence in FASTA format. The beginning of the file might look like this:

```fasta
>Pfluorescens
MIDNKVLVVGVNGFGKTTVAKLNLQDKLNPDVSVDIVEYQPPER...
```

No specific details or modifications to the input files are necessary. Ensure that the FASTA files are in the correct format, with the 'greater than' symbol (`>`) preceding the identifier for each sequence.
