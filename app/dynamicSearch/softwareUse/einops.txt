Use Case: A minimal example of average pooling operation in a machine learning tensorflow application using the einops python library. 

Code details and examples: 

**Code:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf

from einops import rearrange, reduce

# input tensor
x = tf.random.normal((1,64,75,75))

# average pooling operation
pooled_tensor = reduce(x, 'b c (h h2) (w w2) -> b c h w', 'mean', h2=2, w2=2)

```

- b, c, h, w stands for batch, channels, height and width respectively. 
- The tensor ‘x’ is reduced along the height and width axes by a factor of 2, averaging the values.
- 'b c (h h2) (w w2) -> b c h w' is the reduction recipe.

The command to run the code is:

In a jupyter notebook, you can run your cell with SHIFT + ENTER. If it's a ".py" file you can run it from the terminal with the command: `python filename.py`
