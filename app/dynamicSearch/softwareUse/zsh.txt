Use Case: Use for streamline command line interface operations such as auto completion, path expansion, extended file globes and other scripting functions.

Code details and examples: Code

zsh is a shell designed for interactive use, although it is also a powerful scripting language. 

Scripting File: myfile.zsh
```
#!/bin/zsh
# My first script

echo "Hello World!"
```

To make the shell script executable, run this command:

```
chmod +x myfile.zsh
```

To execute the shell script, use this command:

```
./myfile.zsh
```

zsh also provides extensive auto-completion. For example, one could use command:

```
ls /usr/<TAB>
```
This command will list every file and folder in `/usr`.
