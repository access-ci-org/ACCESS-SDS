Use Case: Py-pandas is a Python library used for efficient data manipulation and analysis. It can be used to perform operations on structured data like CSV, Excel data, SQL queries, etc.

Code details and examples:

Code: 
```python
import pandas as pd

# Load dataset
df = pd.read_csv('file.csv')

# View first few rows of the DataFrame
print(df.head())

# Summary statistics
print(df.describe())

# Selecting certain rows from a DataFrame
new_df = df[df['column_name'] > 20]

# Write DataFrame to csv
df.to_csv('newfile.csv', index=False)
```
In the above code, 'file.csv' is a sample input file and it should be in a comma-separated value format. There is no specific specification needed in this case except for the availability of the CSV file. The file 'newfile.csv' is the output file generated by the code.

Command to Run:
If the above code is saved in a script named 'ex_pandas.py', then it can be executed by the following command using the terminal: `python ex_pandas.py`.
