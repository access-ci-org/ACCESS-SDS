Use Case:  "ndiff" is a Python library used for comparing the result of numerical computations. It's helpful in situations where there is a need to compare the output of two or more calculations in order to check the correctness of the mathematical models.

Code details and examples: Code 

To use ndiff, your input file should be in a text format, which contains the output values from numerical computations. 

An example: 

output1.txt: 
 ``` 
1.00000 
3.14159  
6.28318
```
output2.txt: 
 ```
1.00001
3.14160 
6.28319
```
Here, output1.txt and output2.txt are output versions from different numerical computations. 

Command for calculating the difference between output of two numerical computations using ndiff:

`ndiff output1.txt output2.txt`

The command will compare each line in the two output files and print how much they differ. Note that white spaces and comments defined by '#' are ignored.

Now, to use ndiff in a program:

```python
import ndiff
output1 = [1.00000, 3.14159, 6.28318]
output2 = [1.00001, 3.14160, 6.28319]
differences = ndiff.compare(output1, output2)
for diff in differences:
  print(diff)
```

The above code will print the differences between corresponding elements in the two output arrays. 

Remember, you need to install the ndiff Python library before using it. You may use pip or any other Python package manager for installation.
