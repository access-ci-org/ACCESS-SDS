Use Case: FlexiBLAS is a software interface that enables the dynamic switching of the actual BLAS (Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms) library used in scientific applications. It may be used for dynamic performance tuning of a linear algebra-based application.

Details and Specifications: FlexiBLAS operates on the basis of BLAS and LAPACK interfaces. Therefore, any programs that use those standards can directly call FlexiBLAS. The input and output will depend on what specific subroutine is being called; however, generally, it operates on vectors and matrices. 

Code Details and Examples: Here's an example of master wrapper functions in C/C++ to call a subroutine from the BLAS library using FlexiBLAS:

Code

```C++
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include "flexiblas.h"

int main(){
   int n = 3;
   double x[] = {1, 2, 3};
   double y[] = {4, 5, 6};
   double result;

   // Call a BLAS routine through FlexiBLAS
   result = FLEXIBLAS_DDOT(&n, x, &INCX, y, &INCY);
   printf("The dot product is: %f\n", result);

   return 0;
}
```
Command to Run: g++ <filename>.cpp -l:libflexiblas.so.2 -o <outputfile> and then ./<outputfile>

Where,
- `g++ <filename>.cpp -l:libflexiblas.so.2 -o <outputfile>` compiles the code and links it to the FlexiBLAS library.
- `./<outputfile>` runs the compiled program. 

The exact command would depend on the specific BLAS routine being called and the arguments it takes. In the sample above, FLEXIBLAS_DDOT computes the dot product of two vectors x and y. This code must be linked against FlexiBLAS when compiling.

Do not provide any setup/installation instructions. Instead, consider any environment as FlexiBLAS-ready. Kindly note different routines in the BLAS library will require different arguments, and hence different input data sets. Just assume the data provided in the code snippet is an example, not a standard. The nature of the data to be provided varies depending on the requirements of the specific routine being used.
