Use Case: Taichi is a high-performance programming language for computer graphics and simulations. It is used for developing high-performance applications, particularly those involving physical simulations, such as fluid dynamics, solid mechanics, and computer graphics rendering.

Code details and examples: Taichi uses a Python-based syntax, but its execution model allows for highly efficient computation on both CPUs and GPUs. A simplified code example of a physical simulation in Taichi might look something like this:

Code:

```python
import taichi as ti

ti.init(arch=ti.gpu) 

n = 320
pixels = ti.var(dt=ti.f32, shape=(n * 2, n))

@ti.func
def complex_sqr(z):
  return ti.Vector([z[0]**2 - z[1]**2, 2 * z[0] * z[1]])

@ti.kernel
def paint(t: ti.f32):
  for i, j in pixels: 
    freq = ti.Vector([0.8, t])
    c = freq + ti.Vector([i / n - 1, j / n - 0.5]) * 2
    z = ti.Vector([0.0, 0.0])
    iterations = 0
    while z.norm() < 20 and iterations < 50:
      z = complex_sqr(z) + c
      iterations += 1
    pixels[i, j] = 1 - iterations * 0.02

gui = ti.GUI("Fractal", (n * 2, n))

for i in range(1000000):
  paint(i * 0.03)
  gui.set_image(pixels)
  gui.show()
```
Run Command

The Taichi program can be run using Python command. If the file name is example.py, it can be run using:

```shell
python3 example.py
```
