Use Case: Use NTL for dealing with high-performance algorithms for number theory, especially large integers and algebraic computation over finite fields.

Code details and examples: Code

```
#include <NTL/ZZ.h>

using namespace std;
using namespace NTL;

int main() 
{
   ZZ a, b, c;

   cin >> a;
   cin >> b;
   c = (a+1)*(b+1);
   
   cout << "c = " << c << "\n";

   return 0;
}
```
This code snippet demonstrates simple multiplication operation using NTL library. It reads two large integers from standard input, performs multiplication operation and then prints the result.

Input file format: Large_int_1\nLarge_int_2
Input file content example: 

    10000000000000000
    20000000000000000

This represents two large integers which are to be multiplied.

Command to run the above code:
First, we need to compile it using g++ or a suitable C++ compiler:
```
g++ -o main main.cpp -lntl -lgmp
```
Then, run the compiled code:
```
./main
```
