Use Case: Use the testing framework googletest for implementing unit tests in C++. 

Code details and examples: 

Code:

```
#include "gtest/gtest.h"

TEST(MathTest, TwoPlusTwoEqualsFour) {
    EXPECT_EQ(2 + 2, 4);
}

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
    ::testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);
    return RUN_ALL_TESTS();
}
```

In this test suite, we are creating a MathTest suite with a test case TwoPlusTwoEqualsFour. We are testing if the equation 2 + 2 equals 4. There is no need for an input file since the test condition is hardcoded in the test case itself.

Command to Run the test:

```
g++ -std=c++11 -pthread MathTest.cpp libgtest.a -o MathTest
./MathTest
```
