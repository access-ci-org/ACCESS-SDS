Use Case: Aligning two or more biological sequences (such as amino acid or nucleotide sequences) to search for regions of agreement. It can be used for different purposes in bioinformatics, evolution studies, phylogenetics, drug discovery among many others.

Details and examples:

Code:
FASTA has various programs for different cases. For the simplest case - sequence alignment:

FASTA input file:
```
>sequence1
MTEYKLVVVGAGGVGKSALTIQLIQNHFVDEYDPTIEDSYR
>sequence2
MTEYKLVVVGAGGVGKSALTIQLIQNHFVDEYDPTIED
```

This file contains two sequences for alignment. The '>' sign is used to denote a new sequence, followed by the sequence identifier and the sequence itself.

Command to run the program:

`fasta36 -q sequence1.fas sequence2.fas`

This command aligns the sequences in the files sequence1.fas and sequence2.fas using the fasta36 program. The '-q' option suppresses unnecessary information.

Please note that specific ways to run the program and specific options may vary depending on the local FASTA version and configuration.
