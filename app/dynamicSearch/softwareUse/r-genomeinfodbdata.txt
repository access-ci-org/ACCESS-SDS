Use Case: The R-genomeinfodbdata package is used in Bioinformatics to provide version metadata for genomes and chromosomes. This package is used by other packages to ensure a universal mapping of chromosomes to genomes. 

Code details and examples: 

In R, you can use this package by loading it:

```R
library('GenomeInfoDbData')
```

Next, you would use it to map chromosomes to genomes:

```R
genome <- 'hg38'
GenomeInfoDb::seqlengths(genome)
```

In this example, we're asking for the sequence lengths (i.e. chromosome lengths) of the human genome 'hg38' or GRCh38. 

Command to run it: 

You can run it as an R script using the command:

```bash
Rscript RgenomeInfoDbData.R
``` 

(Note: 'RgenomeInfoDbData.R' should be replaced by the script name, if different.)
