Use Case: CirComPara2 is a bioinformatics software used to predict, annotate and analyze circular RNAs (circRNAs) from RNA-seq data. It fuses the output of several established tools into a straightforward workflow and provides several post-processing steps to simplify the circRNA analysis.

Code Details and Examples: Code

Input File Format and Structure:
CirComPara2 requires sorted.bam files as input that have been generated by a splice-aware aligner (like STAR/HISAT2).

Running CirComPara2:

Command:
```
circompara2 -s sample_name \
-i /path/to/bamfile.bam \
-g /path/to/genomeSequence.fa \
-b /path/to/annotation_bedFile.bed \
-a /path/to/annotation_gtfFile.gtf \
-o /path/to/ouput_dir
```
In the command, replace 'sample_name' with the name of your sample; "/path/to/bamfile.bam" with the path to your bam file; "/path/to/genomeSequence.fa" with the path to your genome sequence; "/path/to/annotation_bedFile.bed" with the path to your annotation bed file; "/path/to/annotation_gtfFile.gtf" with the path to your gtf file and "/path/to/ouput_dir" with the path to your output directory.

In case multiple alignments for the same sample in separated BAM should be merged before analysis:

Command:
```
circompara2 -s sample_name \
-i /path/to/bamfile1.bam /path/to/bamfile2.bam [...] \
-g /path/to/genomeSequence.fa \
-b /path/to/annotation_bedFile.bed \
-a /path/to/annotation_gtfFile.gtf \
-o /path/to/ouput_dir \
--bam-merge-alignment-operation union
```
In this command, "/path/to/bamfile1.bam" and "/path/to/bamfile2.bam" are the paths to your bam files which you want to merge.

Note: Commands and file paths should adapt to your local system and configuration.
