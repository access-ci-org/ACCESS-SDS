Use Case: py-cpuinfo is used to get the CPU info. The module doesn't require any input file.

Code details and examples:
```python
import cpuinfo

info = cpuinfo.get_cpu_info()

for key, value in info.items():
   print("{0}: {1}".format(key, value))
```
You can run this python script normally. If this script is named as cpuinfo.py, you can run it as
```bash
python cpuinfo.py
```
This will print the details of the CPU such as brand, Hz, cores, family, model etc.
