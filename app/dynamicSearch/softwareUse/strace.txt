Use Case: Strace is a powerful command-line tool for process troubleshooting and debugging in Linux. It provides a system call trace, signal-related information and other data about the processes running on a Linux system.

Code Details and Examples:

Code:
Strace monitors the system calls and signals of a particular program. Here is an example of how it works. Suppose we have a simple C program:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("Hello, World!");
    return 0;
}
```

This program can be compiled with gcc with the following command:

```bash
gcc program.c -o program
```

To monitor the system calls of this program using strace, the following command can be used:

```bash
strace ./program
```

This will output a list of all system calls invoked by the program. For instance:

```bash
execve("./program", ["./program"], 0x7ffeaa650880 /* 47 vars */) = 0
brk(NULL)                               = 0x561a823d5000
access("/etc/ld.so.preload", R_OK)      = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)
...
write(1, "Hello, World!", 13Hello, World!) = 13
...
+++ exited with 0 +++
```

where each line represents a system call with its parameters, return value and errno status. The output thus provides a trace of all system calls that are used by the process.

Since strace works on binary executables, there is no specific input file format required. The only requirement is to have a runnable binary that can be passed as an argument to strace.
