Use Case: Kalign is used for the alignment of multiple proteins or nucleotide sequences. 

Code details and examples: 

Sample input file format required: FASTA format, as Kalign uses standard FASTA sequence file as an input. For example:

```
>Sequence_1
MPEPAKSAPAPKKGSKKAVTKAQKKDGKKRKRSRKESYSVYVYKVLKQVHPDTGISSKAMGIMNSFVNDIFERIAGEASRLAHYNKRSTITSREIQTAVRLLLPGELAKHAVSEGTKAVTKYTSSK
>Sequence_2
MPEPAKSAPAPKKGSKKAVTKAQKKDGKKRKRSRKESYSTVYVYKVLKQVHPDTGISSKAMGIMNSFVNDIFERIAGEASRLAHYNKRSTITSREIQTAVRLLLPGELAKHAVSEGTKAVTKYTSSK
```

Command to run the alignment:

```bash
kalign -input fastafile.fasta -output alignfile.aln
```
This command takes 'fastafile.fasta' as the input file and writes the output sequence alignment to 'alignfile.aln'. 

Specifications and details: The input sequences are in the FASTA format. The letters in the sequence represent individual amino acids (for protein sequences) or nucleotides (for DNA/RNA sequences). The '>' is used to specify the name (ID) of the sequence. Sequences in the file can be of variable lengths. 

Code: The command is a simple one-liner that does not involve more heavy code. The flags -input specifies the input file name and -output specifies the output file name. 

```bash
kalign -input filename.fasta -output filename.aln
```
