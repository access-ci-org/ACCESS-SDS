Use Case: Use WPS (Weather Research and Forecasting Preprocessing System) for meteorological data preprocessing during numerical weather prediction modeling.

Code details and examples: 

Code:
For using WPS, the main input file is the namelist.wps. This text file contains specific configurations for the WPS modules to run properly. A sample could be:

```
&share
 wrf_core      = 'ARW',
 max_dom       = 2,
 start_date    = '2008-08-29_00:00:00','2008-08-29_00:00:00',
 end_date      = '2008-08-30_00:00:00','2008-08-30_00:00:00',
 interval_seconds = 21600
 io_form_geogrid = 2
/

&geogrid
 parent_id        = 1, 1,
 parent_grid_ratio = 1, 3,
 i_parent_start   = 1, 36,
 j_parent_start   = 1, 41,
 e_we             = 90, 121,
 e_sn             = 72, 100,
 geog_data_res    = '10m','2m',
 dx               = 30000,
 dy               = 30000,
 map_proj         = 'lambert',
 ref_lat          = 40.0,
 ref_lon          = -97.0,
 truelat1         = 33.0,
 truelat2         = 45.0,
 stand_lon        = -97.0,
 geog_data_path   = './GEOG'
/

&ungrib
 out_format       = 'WPS',
 prefix           = 'FILE'
/

&metgrid
 fg_name          = 'FILE'
 io_form_metgrid  = 2
/
```

After configuring this file as per user need and the available data, below are the commands to run the WPS:

```
1. ./geogrid.exe
2. ./ungrib.exe
3. ./metgrid.exe
```

Above three steps are executed sequentially. The `geogrid.exe` generates the geographic information that's needed by the WRF model. The `ungrib.exe` extracts the necessary meteorological fields from the input data. The `metgrid.exe` horizontally interpolates the input meteorological data onto the WRF domains specified in the 'namelist.wps'.
