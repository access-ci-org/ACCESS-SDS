Use Case: VSEARCH is used for several bioinformatics operations such as searching, clustering, chimera detection, and dereplication.
 
Code details and examples: 

Code 1: For sequence searching.

Input File specs: FASTA or FASTQ file, for instance, query.fasta. It should contain the sequences you want to search for.

Command: 
```shell
vsearch --usearch_global query.fasta --db database.fasta --id 0.97 --alnout results.aln
```
Where `--usearch_global` specifies the file with the query sequences, `--db` specifies the database file where the sequences will be searched, `--id` sets the sequence identity threshold, and `--alnout` specifies the output file.

Code 2: For clustering sequences.

Input File specs: FASTA or FASTQ file, for instance, sequences.fasta. It should contain the sequences you want to cluster.

Command: 
```shell
vsearch --cluster_fast sequences.fasta --id 0.97 --centroids cluster.fasta
```
Where `--cluster_fast` specifies the file with sequences to cluster, `--id` sets the sequence identity threshold, and `--centroids` specifies the output file with the centroid sequence for each cluster.
