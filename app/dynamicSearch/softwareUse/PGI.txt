Use Case: PGI, also known as the Portland Group, is a suite of compiler software used for high-performance computing. It supports languages like Fortran, C, and C++ and includes a rich set of compiler-based development tools for parallel computing. 

Code details and examples: Code 

Let's say we have a C++ code in a file named "hello.cpp"

```C++
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() 
{
cout << "Hello, World!";
return 0;
}
```
To compile this file with PGI compiler, the command would be:

```
pgCC -o hello hello.cpp
```
This command will generate an output file named "hello".  To run the output, you should use:

```
./hello
```
It will print "Hello, World!" to the standard output. 

In the command, -o is an option to specify the output file name. If no errors are found, the pgCC command produces an output file that has the specified output file name. 

For Fortran code, the command would be:

```
pgfortran -o hello hello.f90
```

Remember to replace "hello.f90" with your Fortran source code file name. The pgfortran command is used for compiling Fortran source codes.
