Use Case: PopPunk (Population Partitioning Using Nucleotide K-mers) is commonly used in bioinformatics to swiftly assign isolates of bacteria to species, strains or lineages. It has applications in outbreak surveillance, multi-strain infections and tracing bacterial evolution.

Code details and examples:

Code:

The input file for PopPunk is a list of genome assemblies in FASTA format. Required file format is .fasta. The specification for the file: Single line description followed by nucleotide bases (either in single line or in multiple lines). 

FASTA file (input.fasta):
```
>seq0
ATCGGCTAGCT
>seq1
ATCGTATAGCT
```

You can then run PopPunk with the following command:

```bash
poppunk --create-db --r-files genomes.txt --output my_example --k-step 3
```

In this command `genomes.txt` is a text file that lists the path to each genome assembly in your dataset, one on each line:

```bash
/pathto/genome1.fasta
/pathto/genome2.fasta
/pathto/genome3.fasta
```

The `--output` flag specifies the basename for output files, and `--k-step` is used to control the range of k-mer sizes used (default is every number from 14 to 32).

This command will compute all pairwise genome distances and use them to identify clusters of similar genomes, outputting a network in .gt format with edges representing core and accessory genome distances.
