Use Case: LAMMPS (Large-scale Atomic/Molecular Massively Parallel Simulator) is a molecular dynamics library that stands out because it is very modular. It contains many pre-built models for different types of interatomic potentials and properties, and it can be used to simulate a wide variety of systems.

Code details and examples: 

Among the tools included in the LAMMPS distribution, there are some like Pizza.py which is designed to aid with setup and analysis of LAMMPS simulations.

A basic LAMMPS simulation needs at least these two files:

1. A LAMMPS input file. E.g., in.lj 

   In this file, we specify what particles are in the system, what interatomic potentials to use, what thermodynamic conditions to simulate, etc.

   ```
   # 3d Lennard-Jones melt

   units lj
   atom_style atomic

   lattice fcc 0.8442
   region box block 0 4 0 4 0 4
   create_box 1 box
   create_atoms 1 box
   mass 1 1.0
   pair_style lj/cut 2.5
   pair_coeff 1 1 1.0 1.0 2.5

   neighbor 0.3 bin
   neigh_modify delay 0 every 20 check no

   fix 1 all nve

   velocity all create 1.44 87287 loop geom

   thermo 50
   thermo_modify temp new

   dump id all atom 50 dump.melt

   run 1000
   ```

2. A potential file. E.g., lj.lammps

   This is a "library" of many different interatomic potentials that LAMMPS understands, annotated with their parameters.

   ```
   # lj potential file
   LAMMPS Description
   1 1 1 1.0 1.0
   ```

These files are run via the LAMMPS executable, the command to run the files would be something like:

```
lmp_serial -in in.lj
```
