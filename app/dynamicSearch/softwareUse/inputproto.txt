Use Case: inputproto is a package from X.Org that provides header files for the xinput extension library. It doesn't provide any functional binary or library, but other packages might need it as a dependency for compiling.

Code details and examples: Code. Considering the use of inputproto package, we don't normally have an executable code that would use it. However, if we were about to write a C program that monitors the XInput events, it might require the headers from this package. For instance, we might have a snippet of code like this:

```C 
#include <X11/extensions/XInput.h>

void monitorInput(Display *display)
{
    XEvent ev;
    
    while(1)
    {
        XNextEvent(display, &ev);
        
        if (ev.xcookie.type == GenericEvent && ev.xcookie.extension == xi_opcode)
        {
            // handle the XInput event
        }
    }
}
```

During compilation, you might specify the path to the inputproto headers using the -I flag.

```sh 
gcc -I/path/to/inputproto your_program.c -lX11 -lXi -o your_program
```

This command tells gcc to compile 'your_program.c', link it with X11 and Xi libraries, and output the executable to 'your_program'. The '-I' flag tells the compiler where to look for additional header files. The path should be replaced with the actual path to inputproto header files.
