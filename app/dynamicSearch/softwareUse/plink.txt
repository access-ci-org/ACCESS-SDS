Use Case: PLINK is a free, open-source whole genome association analysis toolset, used to perform a range of basic, large-scale analyses in a computationally efficient manner. It is often used in bioinformatics analysis for processing genotypic and phenotypic data in bioinformatics research.

Code details and examples:

Code:

Input Files:
1. Pedigree files in .ped format: Each line of a pedigree file corresponds to a single (diploid) individual in the following simple format: 
"Family ID"
"Individual ID"
"Paternal ID"
"Maternal ID"
"Sex (1=male; 2=female; other=unknown)"
"Phenotype"

2. Map Files in .map format: These are very simple tab (or space) delimited files (i.e., each column represents a distinct field) listing variant information. In single-marker formats, this information must include which chromosome each variant is on, and where.
"Chromosome"
"Variant Identifier"
"Genetic Distance"
"Base-pair position"

Command to run:
plink --file mydata

In this command, 'mydata' is the name of the dataset without the extension. 'plink' commands would look for mydata.ped and mydata.map files.
