Use Case: Ferret is an interactive computer visualization and analysis environment designed to meet the needs of oceanographers and meteorologists analyzing complex sets of data. 

Code details and examples: 

Code:

```sh
yes? USE coads_climatology
yes? SHADE/L=1 sst
```

Input Files:
The only file loaded and used by Ferret is the one specified in the USE command. In this case, that's coads_climatology.

Format Required:
Ferret reads netCDF files, a common file format for storing multidimensional scientific data (variables) such as temperature, humidity, pressure, wind speed and direction. 

Specifications and Details:
All data files loaded by Ferret must be in the form of netCDF files. Ferret can, however, create ASCII, Binary, or even netCDF data files from data that live purely in memory.

Command to run:

Ferret can run in both interactive mode and batch mode. For interactive mode, you just type ferret at the command line. For batch mode, you would write your script (like the one above) to a file, say script.jnl, and then run it with Ferret like so:

```sh
ferret < script.jnl
```
