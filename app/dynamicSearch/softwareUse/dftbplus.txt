Use Case: DFTB+ (Density Functional based Tight Binding) is a fast and efficient versatile quantum mechanical simulation program. It is based on the DFTB method, making it suitable for molecular dynamics, structure optimization and excited state calculations. The main use case would be for performing quick quantum mechanical simulations without having to resort to 'heavy' traditional DFT methods.

Code details and examples: 
For DFTB+, the input file is typically named `dftb_in.hsd` and uses hierarchical data format. A sample input file of DFTB+ for a single water molecule can be like this:

```
Geometry = XYZ {   
3   
water molecule
O         0.000000    0.000000    0.000000
H         0.000000    0.738000    0.582000
H         0.000000   -0.738000    0.582000
}
Driver = {}
Hamiltonian = DFTB {
  SCC = Yes
  SlaterKosterFiles = Type2FileNames {
    Prefix = "/usr/share/dftb+/slako/"
    Separator = "-"
    Suffix = ".skf"
  }
  MaxAngularMomentum {
    O = "p"
    H = "s"
  }
  Charge = 0.0
}
```
The command to run a DFTB+ job is typically:

```
dftb+ > output.log
```
This will run DFTB+ using the input file `dftb_in.hsd` and the output will be redirected to `output.log`. The Slater-Koster files which contain the parameters needed for calculation are specified in the Hamiltonian block, the path must lead to the location of the suitable SK files for the system being examined. MaxAngularMomentum defines the angular momentum quantum numbers of the valence atomic orbitals used in the calculation for each species.
