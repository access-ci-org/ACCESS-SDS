Use Case: Use PICRUSt2 (Phylogenetic Investigation of Communities by Reconstruction of Unobserved States) for metagenome prediction

Code details and examples:

Code:

Input for PICRUSt2 is typically a pair of files: The first is a sequence file in FASTA format which should contain 16S rRNA gene sequences that have already been quality-controlled and clustered into OTUs. The second is a tab-delimited text file that maps each sequence to its corresponding OTU abundance.

### Input file 1: FASTA file
```
>OTU_1
ACTGCTAGCTAGCTCGATCGATCGCATGCATCTCGATCGCACTG
>OTU_2
ATCGATAGCTCGATCGATCGATCGATCGCTAGCTAGCTAGTACG
...

### Input file 2: OTU abundance
OTU_ID    sample1    sample2    sample3    ...
OTU_1     10         0          30         ...
OTU_2     0          20         10         ...
...
```
Command to run: Each individual step can be run with BASH on a Unix-based system:

Step 1: Align the representative sequences: 
```bash
place_seqs.py -s marker.fasta -o out.tre -p 1
```
Step 2: Calculate gene family abundances using the above produced files with default parameters and a number of threads specified, here 1:
```bash
castor.py -i marker.fasta -o count_table.tsv -g out.tre -n -p 1
```
Step 3: Normalizes each sample in this file by its 16S rRNA gene copy number:
```bash
normalize.py -i marker.fasta -o normalize_out.tre
```
All together as one script:
 ```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -e

place_seqs.py -s marker.fasta -o out.tre -p 1
castor.py -i marker.fasta -o count_table.tsv -g out.tre -n -p 1
normalize.py -i marker.fasta -o normalize_out.tre
```
Save this script as `run_picrust2.sh` and run with `bash run_picrust2.sh`.
