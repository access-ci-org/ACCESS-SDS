Use Case: skae is a Python library that provides tools for astronomers to remove cosmic ray hits in astronomical images.; 

Code Details and Examples: 

Cosmic ray hits in astronomical images can be identified and cleaned using skae. Normally, this is done by using a sigma-clipping algorithm to identify pixels which are disproportionately bright compared to their neighbors.

In this example, we use skae to clean an image 'image.fits' (FITS is the standard image format in astronomy). 

```python
# import skae
from skae import Skae

# create an instance of the Skae
skae = Skae('dark.fits')

# Input details: 'dark.fits' is an example of a 2D image file in FITS format, with the assumption that each pixel value represents the intensity. Details in the input file 'image.fits' will be read as a 2D array, with a value representing the intensity of light at that pixel.

# clean the image using skae's 'clean_image' function
skae.clean_image('image.fits')
```

To run the command:

```shell
$ python clean_image.py
```

Here, 'clean_image.py' is the Python script containing the above code.
