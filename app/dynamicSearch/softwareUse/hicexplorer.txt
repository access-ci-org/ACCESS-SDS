Use Case: HiCExplorer is used for processing and visualization of Hi-C data. It takes in a Hi-C matrix file in .h5 format and a minimum resolution value for processing.

Code details and examples: Code

To generate and correct Hi-C matrix, a typical command line can be written as:

```bash
hicBuildMatrix --samFiles sample1.sam sample2.sam \
--binSize 10000 \
--restrictionCutFile rg.txt \
--restrictionSequence GATC \
--minDistance 500 \
--maxDistance 20000 \
--outFileName matrix.h5 \
--QCfolder HiCQC
```

The restriction cut file (rg.txt) includes sequences with restriction enzyme recognition sites. The sam files are the alignment results of Hi-C sequencing data. The binSize parameter sets the resolution of Hi-C map.

To normalize Hi-C matrix, a simple normalization (like Knight-Ruiz) can be applied as follows:

```bash
hicCorrectMatrix correct --matrix matrix.h5 --correctionMethod KR --chromosomes chr1 --outFileName matrix_corrected.h5
```

It normalizes the matrix file generated in the previous step. The chromosome to be processed is indicated by "--chromosomes".

Visualization of Hi-C matrix can be done by plotting the matrix

```bash
hicPlotMatrix --matrix matrix_corrected.h5 --outFileName matrix_plot.png
```

This will generate a plot of the normalized Hi-C matrix. The format is a PNG image. 

For interacting with the Hi-C spots, a Hi-C matrix coordinate file (in BED format) is required. An example coordinate file can have lines such as:

chr1    10000    20000
chr1    30000    40000

This represents two genomic regions on chromosome 1, each is 10kb in size.
