Use Case: Pydantic is a validation library in Python used to validate data structures like data classes and other mutable containers using Python type annotations. 

Code Details and Examples: 

Code:

Firstly you import the BaseModel class from pydantic. Then, you create a class, which includes the data attributes and their types that you want to validate. 

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel

class User(BaseModel):
    id: int
    name: str
    email: str
```

After you have the class setup, you then create an instance of the class providing the data that you want to validate. 

```python
user_data = {'id': 123, 'name': 'John Doe', 'email': 'johndoe@example.com'}
user = User(**user_data)
```

Once you provide the data, the data gets validated by Pydantic. If the data is valid, you can access the data just like any other normal class. elif there's an issue with the data, Pydantic raises an error.

```python
print(user.id)  # Will print 123
print(user.name)  # Will print 'John Doe'
print(user.email)  # Will print 'johndoe@example.com'
```

To run the above code, save the file and run python filename.py from the command line.
