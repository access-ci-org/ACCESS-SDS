Use Case: Use Cubewriter as a Python library used for generating .cube files which are a standard format for representing 3D scalar fields such as electrostatic potential or electron density in computational chemistry.

Code details and examples: Code 

The CubeFile class can be used to create, access and manipulate .cube files.

```
from cubewriter import CubeFile

# Create a new cube file
c = CubeFile()

# Set some properties
c.comment1 = 'This is a comment.'
c.comment2 = 'This is another comment.'
c.origin = [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]

# Load data from numpy array
import numpy as np
data = np.random.rand(3, 3, 3)
c.data = data

# Save to a file
c.to_file('output.cube')
```
The input for cubewriter is just set inside the code. It should have these properties set: comment1, comment2, origin, and data. Origin is a list of three coordinates that represent the origin of the grid. Data is a numpy array that contains the values of the grid points.

To run:

If you are using it as a script then from the terminal/command prompt:
```
python filename.py
```

If you are executing this inside an IDE or Jupyter Notebook, then no specific command is required, it's executed as the cells are run.
