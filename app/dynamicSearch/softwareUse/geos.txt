Use Case: GEOS (Geometry Engine Open Source) is a C++ library for performing operations on two-dimensional geometric shapes. This software is useful in applications such as GIS, virtual globe rendering, and computer-aided design. An example use case is checking whether two shapes intersect.

Code details and examples: 

Code:

```python
from shapely import geometry
from shapely import geos

polygon1 = geometry.Polygon([(0, 0), (5, 0), (5, 5)])
polygon2 = geometry.Polygon([(2, 2), (6, 2), (6, 6)])

print(geos.TopologicalError(polygon1, polygon2))
```

In this example, we're creating two Polygon objects using the shapely.geometry.Polygon class, and then using the geos.TopologicalError to determine if these two polygons intersect each other.

The input for this function is two geometrical objects, created through the shapely.geometry. Polygon constructor. Each argument of this constructor is a tuple representing the coordinates of a point of the polygon. 

To run this python code snippet, save it to a Python file, say test_geos.py. Then, run the file in a terminal.

Command to run:

```bash
python3 test_geos.py
```
