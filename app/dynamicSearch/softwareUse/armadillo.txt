Use Case: Armadillo is an open-source C++ linear algebra library (matrix maths) aiming towards a good balance between speed and ease of use. The syntax is deliberately similar to Matlab. Integer, floating point and complex numbers are supported, as well as a subset of trigonometric and statistics functions. 

Code details and examples: 

Code:
```C++
#include <iostream>
#include <armadillo>

int main()
{
  // Initializing a matrix of zeros
  arma::mat A = arma::zeros<arma::mat>(4,5);

  // Adding values to the matrix
  A(1,2) = 2.0;  
  A(3,2) = -1.0;
  
  // Output the matrix
  std::cout << "A: \n" << A << "\n";

  // Computations
  arma::mat B = arma::randu<arma::mat>(4,5);
  std::cout << "B: \n" << B << "\n";

  arma::mat C = A + B;
  std::cout << "C: \n" << C << "\n";

  return 0;
}
```
Running the code:

To compile the code with Armadillo, the typical command would be:

```shell
g++ -std=c++11 -O2 -DARMA_NO_DEBUG -lopenblas -llapack example.cpp -o example
```

Then, run the resulting executable with the command:

```shell
./example
```
