Use Case: Visualize and manipulate molecular structures in 3D using a Jupyter Notebook. 

Code details and examples: Code

```python
import py3Dmol

# Initialize a viewer and add a model
viewer = py3Dmol.view(query='pdb:1dc9')
viewer.setStyle({'cartoon': {'color':'spectrum'}})
viewer.zoomTo()
viewer.show()
```
No input files are needed, instead, the code refers directly to a Protein Data Bank (PDB) id. The data is then fetched online. There is also an option to load data from a local file in PDB format or other recognized structures.

Command to run it: After scripting, it is enough to run the Python script in an environment where py3Dmol has been installed. In this case, a Jupyter Notebook is used.
