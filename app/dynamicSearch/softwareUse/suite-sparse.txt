Use Case: SuiteSparse is a collection of libraries for computations involving sparse matrices. It's used in linear algebraic procedures such as solving linear systems, factoring matrices, estimating ranks, and computing numerical solutions to various other problems. 

Code details and examples: 

The SuiteSparse software package comprises several libraries. Let's use one of its libraries, CHOLMOD, which is a set of routines for factorizing sparse symmetric positive definite matrices of the form `Ax=b`.

Input file example: The input file should contain the coefficients of matrix A and vector b. SuiteSparse input files are usually in the Matrix Market format (.mtx).

For instance, a symmetric 3x3 matrix may look like this:

```
%%MatrixMarket matrix coordinate real symmetric
3 3 6
1 1 1.0
2 2 2.0
3 3 3.0
1 2 4.0
2 3 5.0
1 3 6.0
```

Here are coefficients of `Ax=b`. There are 3 rows, 3 columns, and 6 non-zero elements. The following 6 lines contain row indices, column indices, and values of the non-zero elements.

To use CHOLMOD, include cholmod.h header file in your code. Here is a simple example of how to create sparse matrix:

Code: 

```C
#include <cholmod.h>

/* Start CHOLMOD */
cholmod_common c;
cholmod_start (&c);

/* create sparse matrix */
int n = 3;
int Ap [ ] = {0, 2, 3, 6};
int Ai [ ] = {0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 2};
double Ax [ ] = {2., 3., -1., 3., 4., -3.};
cholmod_sparse* A;
A = cholmod_allocate_sparse (n, n, 6, 0, 1, 0, CHOLMOD_REAL, &c) ;
A->p = Ap ;
A->i = Ai ;
A->x = Ax ;

// then proceed with linear system solution or matrix factorization

/* terminate CHOLMOD */
cholmod_finish (&c);
```

Command to run (if available):

When using CHOLMOD, you need to link against the CHOLMOD library. The way to do this depends on your build system. If you are using the gcc compiler, you might do something like:
```shell
gcc your_program.c -o your_program -lcholmod
```
