Use Case: libffi is a supporting package that provides a portable, high level programming interface to various calling conventions in C. It can be used in scenarios where you need a bridge between different programming languages, for instance calling C routines from higher language like Python.

Code details and examples:

Code:

Here is an example of using `libffi` to call the `puts` function from the C Standard Library. You will need a C file and a Python file.

First, the C file. This one is written to be included (not compiled on its own). Call this `func.c`:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

void print_hello(void) {
  puts("Hello, world!");
}
```

Make a shared object `libfunc.so` using the C file `func.c`:

```shell
$ gcc -shared -o libfunc.so func.c
```

Next the Python file. This one uses `ctypes` with libffi to call our `puts` function from `libfunc.so`. Call this file `call_func.py`:

```python
import ctypes

# Load the shared object into ctypes
libfunc = ctypes.CDLL('./libfunc.so')

# Provide the necessary argument type information
# In this case, no arguments are needed
libfunc.print_hello.argtypes = []

# Call the function
libfunc.print_hello()
```

Command to run:

```shell
$ python call_func.py
```

You'll then see `Hello, world!` printed to STDOUT.

In terms of input files, this example only involves source code files (one in C, one in Python). The C file outlines a function `print_hello()` and the Python file uses `ctypes` (which utilises libffi) to load the shared library created from the C file and call that function. No additional specifications or formats are needed, although in more advanced use cases, the C function might accept arguments for which libffi needs correct type hinting.
