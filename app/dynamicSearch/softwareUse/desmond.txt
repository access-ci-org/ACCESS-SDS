Use Case: Desmond is a software package under high-performance scientific computing software. It is used for molecular dynamics simulations and is known for high performance. Useful for research in biological and materials sciences.

Code details and examples: Code.

Desmond uses an input file format that is called .cfg

Sample code for a Desmond input file:

<code>
# Desmond config file
temperature     = 300
pressure        = 1
simulation_time = 100
num_steps       = 1000000
output_freq     = 1000
structure_file  = input.pdb
</code>

The input file requires certain parameters to run the simulation. 
- The 'temperature' specifies the temperature (in Kelvin) at which the simulation should occur.
- The 'pressure' sets the pressure (in atm) for the simulation. 
- 'simulation_time' sets the duration (in ps) for the simulation.
- 'num_steps' sets the total simulation steps.
- The 'output_freq' represents how often (in steps) the program writes to the output. 
- 'structure_file' is the location of the structure file (.pdb format) which contains the structure of the molecule you want to simulate.

The command to run Desmond:

<code>
desmond --config my_config.cfg
</code>

In this command, 'my_config.cfg' needs to be replaced with the name of your Desmond configuration file.
