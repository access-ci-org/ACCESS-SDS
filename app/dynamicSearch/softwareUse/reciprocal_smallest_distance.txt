Use Case: The reciprocal smallest distance software can be used in computational chemistry to calculate the reciprocal of the smallest distance between atoms in a molecule. This software is typically used in research and industrial settings to measure interatomic distances in complex molecules such as proteins or polymers. 

Code Details and Examples: 

Input: 

The input file could be the three-dimensional coordinates of the atoms in the molecule. It can be present in a .xyz format which is as follows -

 7

 N        0.000000     1.337257     0.000000

 H        0.000000     0.000000     0.000000

 H        0.000000     1.337257     1.093097

 H        0.951206     1.337257     -0.546549

 H       -0.951206     1.337257     -0.546549

Specifications in input files: 

.xyz file should consist of

- The first line: the number of atoms
- The second line: a comment
- The rest: atomic_symbols and x, y, z coordinates

Here is an example of python code that reads the .xyz file, calculates the smallest distance and finds its reciprocal:

Code: 

```python
import math

def read_xyz(filename):
    atoms = []
    with open(filename, 'r') as f:
        for line in f.readlines()[2:]:
            atom = line.split()
            atoms.append((atom[0], float(atom[1]), float(atom[2]), float(atom[3])))
    return atoms

def calculate_distance(atom1, atom2):
    x_distance = atom1[1] - atom2[1]
    y_distance = atom1[2] - atom2[2]
    z_distance = atom1[3] - atom2[3]
    return math.sqrt(x_distance**2 + y_distance**2 + z_distance**2)

def reciprocal_smallest_distance(filename):
    atoms = read_xyz(filename)
    smallest_distance = calculate_distance(atoms[0], atoms[1])
    for i in range(len(atoms)):
        for j in range(i+1, len(atoms)):
            distance = calculate_distance(atoms[i], atoms[j])
            if distance < smallest_distance:
                smallest_distance = distance
    return 1.0 / smallest_distance
```

Command to run: 

You would want to call the `reciprocal_smallest_distance` function with the filename of your .xyz file as argument, in the Python interpreter or in your script where the functions are defined. For instance:

```python
print(reciprocal_smallest_distance("molecule.xyz"))
``` 

This would output the reciprocal of the smallest distance in the molecule described in the "molecule.xyz" file.
