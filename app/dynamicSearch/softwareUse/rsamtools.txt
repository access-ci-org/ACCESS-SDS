Use Case: The Rsamtools package in R is primarily used for high-performance reading, writing and modification of Sequence Alignment Map (SAM) files and Binary Alignment Map (BAM) files, which are common formats for storing large-scale, high-throughput sequencing data. It'll be utilized for handling BAM files in genomic analysis.

Code Details and Examples:

```R
library(Rsamtools)
bamfile <- system.file('extdata', 'ex1.bam', package='Rsamtools')

# Specify the param indicating the sequences to fetch from the file.
param <- ScanBamParam(what=scanBamWhat(), flag=scanBamFlag(isUnmappedQuery=FALSE))
header <- scanBamHeader(bamfile)
res <- scanBam(bamfile, param=param)

# Accessing the BAM file
bam <- BamFile(bamfile, yieldSize=1e5)
```

Please replace 'ex1.bam' with the path to your own .bam file. No special formatting or specifications are needed for the input file; it just needs to be a valid .bam file. Command to run is not applicable as Rsamtools is an R package and the code should be run within an R environment.
