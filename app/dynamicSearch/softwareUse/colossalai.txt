Use Case: ColossalAI is a high-performance deep learning system designed to support model and pipeline parallelism for training large models. It simplifies the process of using a cluster of GPUs in a unifying way by handling hundreds of GPUs across multiple nodes.

Code details and examples: 

Code example 1: 

```python
# Import required packages
from colossalai.context import Config
from colossalai.utils import print_rank_0

# Set configuration
config = Config('./path_to_your_config_file/config.yaml')

# Define a function for efficiency
def run():
    # Place your model creation and training logic here

# Set parameter
parameter = './path_to_your_parameter_file/parameter.txt'

# Print the rank
print_rank_0(f'Parameter: {parameter}')
    
# Call function
run()
```

For run command: python [filename].py

Please replace the './path_to_your_config_file/config.yaml' and './path_to_your_parameter_file/parameter.txt' with your actual file paths. Entries in 'config.yaml' should be in a valid YAML format with parameters for setting up the model parallelism, pipeline parallelism, and tensor parallelism. Please consult the ColossalAI's [documentation](https://colossal-ai.readthedocs.io/). 

Parameter.txt should contain the parameters required for training the model in the following form: 
```
parameter1: value1
parameter2: value2
```

Code Example 2: Initializing a model in ColossalAI.

```python
from colossalai.core import global_context as gpc
from colossalai.utils import print_rank_0
from colossalai.engine import Engine
import torch.nn as nn

class SimpleModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.linear = nn.Linear(10, 10)

    def forward(self, x):
        return self.linear(x)
 
if __name__ == '__main__':
    engine = Engine('./path_to_your_config_file/config.yaml')
    model = SimpleModel()

    if gpc.is_initialized(): # check if the parallel context has been initialized
        model = model.to(gpc.get_default_device()) # send the model to the default device
    else: 
        print_rank_0('Parallel context has not been initialized')

    engine.setup_optimizer(model)
    engine.setup_lr_scheduler(model)
    engine.train(100, model)

    engine.destroy() # destroy the engine after use
```
The configuration file and the parameter paths should be replaced with actual paths. This example demonstrates the setup of a simple linear model, and requires that the parallel context is initialized and the model is sent to the default device for computation. The model setup, optimization, scheduling and training logic must be placed within the 'run' function.
