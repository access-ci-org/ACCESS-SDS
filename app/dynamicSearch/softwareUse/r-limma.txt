Use Case: Use of R-Limma for analyzing microarray data and identifying differentially expressed genes.

Code details and examples:

To use R-Limma, you first need to import the microarray data and this is typically in .CEL format:

```
# Import necessary library
library(affy)

# Read in CEL files
data <- ReadAffy(filenames = list.celfiles())

```

Next, normalize the data using RMA (Robust Multi-chip Average) normalization provided by the affy package:

```
# Normalize data
data_normalized <- rma(data)
```

Then, design the experiment matrix. The design matrix for a very basic experiment with a control and a treatment group would look like the following:

``` 
# Example design matrix
group <- factor(c(rep("control",5), rep("treatment",5)))
design <- model.matrix(~0+group)
```

Perform linear modeling and calculate statistics using the limma package:

```
# Import library
library(limma)

# Fit model
fit <- lmFit(data_normalized, design)

# Perform eBayes moderation
fit_eBayes <- eBayes(fit)

# Output results
results <- topTable(fit_eBayes, adjust="fdr", sort.by="B", number=Inf)
```

Command to run:

Since the above sample is a R script, to run it, save it as a '.R' file (example: `limma_example.R`) and execute it in the command line using Rscript:

```
Rscript limma_example.R
```

Input file required: Microarray data file(s) in .CEL format. Importantly, each row represents a separate gene and each column represents a different sample. Samples are labeled as belonging to either a control or treatment group in the design matrix.

Specifications of input files: The .CEL files should come from the Affymetrix GeneChip array platform. The order of filenames passed to `ReadAffy()` should match the order of sample groups defined in the design matrix. Your group variable definitions should match the actual groups in your design matrix.
