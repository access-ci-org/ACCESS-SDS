Use Case: Py-HTSeq is a Python library to allow reading, writing, and manipulating high-throughput sequencing data. It is majorly used in the field of genomics and bioinformatics to analyze sequencing data files.

Code details and examples:

Code:
A typical application is the domain of high-throughput sequencing data analyses. Here is an example of how you can read in sequenceing reads from a file in SAM format:

```python
import HTSeq
samfile = HTSeq.SAM_Reader("my_file.sam")
for aln in samfile:
    # Code for processing the alignment, e.g.
    print(aln.read.name)
```
The input file ("my_file.sam") is the path to a SAM or BAM file, which is a standardized format used to store large nucleotide sequence alignments. The exact specifications of this format can be found in the SAM format specification document.

Command to run:
In python environment, you can execute your python script (say "script.py") containing the above code by the following command

```bash
python script.py
```
This will run the script, and results will be output on the console or into the file depending on how the script is written. Make sure to replace 'my_file.sam' with the path to your actual SAM file. This is your input file.
