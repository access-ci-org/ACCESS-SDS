Use Case: Plotting a curve from a data file in gnuplot.

Code details and examples: 

Input File Format: The input file should be a text file, with one datum per line. For plotting a 2D curve, each line should have two fields, the x-coordinate and the y-coordinate, separated by a space.

Input File Specifications: Let name the file as `datafile.dat`, and imagine it as follows,

```
1 2
2 3
3 4
4 5
5 6
```

Code Snippet:

```gnuplot
plot "datafile.dat" using 1:2 with linespoints
```

This will generate a plot using the data in the 'datafile.dat', using the first column for the X-axis and the second column for the Y-axis. The keyword 'with' decides how the data will be portrayed ('lines', 'points', 'linespoints', 'dots', etc.)

Command to run the code: First, launch gnuplot by typing `gnuplot` in your terminal. Once inside the gnuplot interactive shell, you can run the above command. Alternatively, you could save the above command in a file (say `script.gpl`), and then run gnuplot with this file as an argument, like so:

```bash
gnuplot script.gpl
```
