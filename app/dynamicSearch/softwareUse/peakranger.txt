Use Case: PeakRanger is a robust open source software that detects peaks from ChIP-seq data. It is capable of calling broad and narrow peaks besides quantifying them.

Code Details and Examples: Code

PeakRanger software takes raw aligned reads and detects positions of DNA-binding proteins or chromatin modifications.

Input files required: two .bam files, one for control input and the other for ChIP sample.

For example, if you have two .bam files named "control.bam" and "sample.bam", and you want to call peaks, and you would use the following command:

```bash
peakranger ranger --format bam -d control.bam -r sample.bam -o peaks.txt
```

The "-d" flag is for the ChIP sample, "-r" is for the control, "--format" is to specify that inputs are .bam files, and "-o" is for output file.

In the output file, named here as "peaks.txt", each line represents a peak region. The fields start with chromosome name, start and end positions, peak name (which is in the form of "chr1_peak_1"), score, strand, and signal value.

Please note that proper function requires that the control and test files are aligned to the exact same reference genome. 

Also, please note that .bam files are usually produced by aligning the reads with any aligner like Novoalign, BWA, or Bowtie and then sorted using a tool like samtools. This sorting step is crucial as the tool expects sorted .bam files as its input. 

Besides, .bam files should have indexed files (.bai) present in the same directory, which can be produced with samtools as:

```bash
samtools index control.bam
samtools index sample.bam
``` 

Where control.bam and sample.bam are your input .bam files. This will create .bai files with same names in the same directory.
