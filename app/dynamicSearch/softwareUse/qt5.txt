Use Case: Use qt5 toolkit to develop a simple GUI for displaying a "Hello, World" message.

Code details and examples: Code:
```python
from PyQt5.QtWidgets import QApplication, QLabel

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app = QApplication([])

    label = QLabel('Hello, World!')
    label.show()

    app.exec_()
```

For PyQt5, no specific input files or formats are needed. What's needed is the Python code to define the GUI. In this case, a QLabel is used to display a message. QApplications manages the GUI application's control flow and main settings.

To run the PyQt5 program, simply use:
```bash
python3 filename.py
```
Replace "filename.py" with the actual Python script filename. This assumes that Python 3 and PyQt5 have been installed on the system.
