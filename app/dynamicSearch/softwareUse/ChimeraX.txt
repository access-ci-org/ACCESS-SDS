Use Case: ChimeraX is a high-performance software for visualizing molecular structures, densities, and trajectories, plus analysis and scripting capabilities.

Code Details and Examples: ChimeraX provides multiple commands for representing and analyzing structures. It also provides functionalities to load and analyze 3D structures directly from PDB files.

For example, consider we have protein structure file named "protein.pdb". The following steps could apply:

1) Opening the PDB File:

Code: 
```
open protein.pdb
```

This command will open and visualize the structure directly from the file named "protein.pdb". 

2) Coloring the structure:

Code:
```
color #FF0000
```

This command will color the currently selected molecule in red.

3) Saving images:

Code:
```
save ~/Desktop/protein.png
```

This command will save an image of the current view of the molecule to a file named "protein.png" on the Desktop. 

The ChimeraX command language is used to interactively run specific actions. It is text-based and entered in a command line, similar to scripting languages.
