Use Case: R-Studio Server is an integrated development environment (IDE) developed by Rstudio, Inc. for R, a programming language for statistical computing and graphics. It is used by data scientists and statisticians for data analysis and visualization. 

Code details and examples: Code.

For the demonstration, let's presume an R script file named 'demo.R' which includes a basic algorithm to calculate the mean of numbers in a list:

```r
# demo.R
numbers <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 60) 
mean_val <- mean(numbers)
print(paste("Mean value is:", mean_val))
```

This script creates a list of numbers and computes the mean value. Then, it prints out the mean value with a string "Mean value is:".

Command to run demo.R in R-Studio Server environment:

```bash
Rscript demo.R
```

In RStudio Server, you just need to open the file 'demo.R' and then press 'Ctrl+Enter' to run it (or you can click on the 'Run' button).

Please note that the inputs in this script are hard-coded, for scripts with file inputs the format will depend on the code inside the script; it could be a csv, text file, etc. The script will typically have instructions for how to format the input file within the code comments. 

In a more complex use case scenario, this function could be used inside a larger script to perform more complex data analysis and visualization. For instance, it could be used to calculate the mean value of a specific column in a dataframe, in which case the input would be the dataframe itself, typically in a .csv or .xlsx file. The file would need to be formatted with column headers and consistent data types within each column.
