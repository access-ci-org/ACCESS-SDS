Use Case: Motif is used for finding patterns in biological sequences. It is commonly used in bioinformatics to identify and analyze patterns in DNA, RNA, or protein sequences. 

Code Details and Examples: 

Code:

1. Sample Input File (FASTA format):

```
>sequence1
ATGCATGCATGC
>sequence2
CGTACGTACGTA
>sequence3
TATGTATGTATG
```

The FASTA file contains three sequences named 'sequence1', 'sequence2', 'sequence3', each of which has a unique pattern of nucleotides.

2. Running Motif:

Before running Motif, the tool should be in your PATH. If your FASTA file is 'sequences.fasta', the command to run is:

```
motif sequences.fasta
```

The output will be a list of motifs (recurring patterns) found in the sequences. For example:

```
>motif1
ATGC
>motif2
CGTA
>motif3
TATG
```

Each motif is listed with its unique identifier and the sequence of the motif itself.

Note: This is a hypothetical use case and command. The actual usage and command may vary based on the version and actual functioning of the Motif software. Please refer to the software documentation for actual usage.

3. Specifications and Details in Input Files:

The input file format required by Motif is a FASTA file, which is text-based and includes a sequence identifier and the nucleotide/protein sequence. The sequence identifier starts with a ">" symbol and the sequence follows that. The sequence can be in upper or lower case and can include any valid nucleotide or protein symbol.

4. Sample Code Snippet:

There's no explicit code snippet for running Motif as it's a command-line tool. The use of Motif is generally through commands, not through programming interfaces.
