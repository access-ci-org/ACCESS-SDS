Use Case: Score-P is a tool for measurement of software execution profile in high performance computing systems. It is used mainly for managing performance measurements like collecting, storing, and managing performance data.

Code details and examples: 

Code:
For C/C++ programs, it can be used in the following way:

Typically, Score-P uses two commands for instrumentation. 

```
scorep gcc test.c -o test
```

Here, scorep works as the compiler by wrapping around the gcc compiler. "test.c" is the example inputs file in C, and "test" is the output executable filename.

To run this executable with Score-P, we use:

```
scorep ./test
```

If the input file requires arguments, they can be provided in the following way:

```
scorep ./test arg1 arg2
```

Once the program has been run, Score-P will generate a measurement directory which contains the profiling data.

It is also possible to control the level of instrumentation. For example, a user can select to instrument only user functions, but not MPI for a MPI C program. It can be done using environment variable:

```
export SCOREP_ENABLE_PROFILING="true"
export SCOREP_ENABLE_TRACING="false"
```

Then compile and run the code with scorep.

Please note that the specific input file and requirements might change depending on the software or program being profiled. Score-P supports more complex scenarios, as well as the ability to specify which parts of the code to measure. This makes it a flexible tool to measure performance of a wide variety of programs.});
