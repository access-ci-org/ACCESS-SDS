Use Case: Use Pyro to implement a Bayesian Linear Regression model. Pyro is a probabilistic programming language that is implemented in python and can be used to model complex, hierarchical and stochastic relationships in data.

Code Details and Examples: 

Code:

```
import pyro
import pyro.distributions as dist
import torch

def model(data):
    # priors 
    alpha = pyro.sample("alpha", dist.Normal(0., 1.))
    beta = pyro.sample("beta", dist.Normal(0., 1.))
    sigma = pyro.sample("sigma", dist.Uniform(0., 10.))
    
    # likelihood
    for i in range(len(data)):
        mu = alpha + beta * data[i, :-1]
        pyro.sample("obs_{}".format(i), dist.Normal(mu, sigma), obs=data[i, -1])

data = torch.randn((100, 2))  # 100 data points in 2D
model(data)
```

The input to the model function is a 2D Torch Tensor where each row represents a data point and each column represents a feature. Here each row of the data tensor has one feature and a response in the end. So a total two columns.

Command to Run:

You run the code as a regular python script or in a Jupyter notebook. The Python runtime requirements for Pyro are Python >= 3.6 and PyTorch >= 1.3.1. This is for a Bayesian Linear Regression model, but Pyro can be used to create more complex, hierarchical and even deep learning models.

After defining the model you can use Pyro's inference and optimization utilities to, for example, perform stochastic variational inference.
```
from pyro.infer import SVI, Trace_ELBO
from pyro.optim import Adam

svi = SVI(model, guide, Adam({"lr": 0.003}), loss=Trace_ELBO())

losses = []
for step in range(1000):
    losses.append(svi.step(data))

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.plot(losses)
plt.title("ELBO")
plt.xlabel("step")
plt.ylabel("loss");
```
