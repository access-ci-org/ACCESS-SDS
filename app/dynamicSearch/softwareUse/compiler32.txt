Use Case: Compiler32 is a generic placeholder for any compiler specific to a 32-bit system. We will use this for a use case of compiling a simple C++ program. The input file required is a .cpp file which contains valid C++ code.

Code details and examples: 

Code:
```c++
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() 
{
  cout<<"Hello, World!";
  return 0;
}
```
This code is saved as HelloWorld.cpp.

The command to compile and run the code using the g++ compiler (which could be substituted with 'compiler32' if that was an actual compiler) in a Unix-like operating system like Linux or MacOS is as follows:

```shell
g++ HelloWorld.cpp -o HelloWorld
./HelloWorld
```

This command compiles HelloWorld.cpp and the output executable is HelloWorld. Second command runs the HelloWorld executable file. 

Output will be: `Hello, World!`

Note: If you were using a different compiler or operating system, the compile command might look different. For example, if you were using the Microsoft compiler on Windows, you would use the `cl` command to compile. If you were using a Java compiler, you would use the `javac` command to compile, and so on. Also, the compile command will vary depending on whether the code is C++, Java, Python, etc.
