Use Case: This package is used as a pre-processing tool for nanopore sequencing data. It allows removal of reads that are derived from the internal control spike-in Lambda Phage.

Code details and examples: Code 

The input files for Nanolyse include FASTQ or compressed .gz FASTQ files. The files must contain nanopore sequencing data. 

```python
# First, import the Nanolyse module
from nanolyse import Nanolyse

# Specify the input file and reference genome
input_file = 'reads.fastq'
reference_genome = 'lambda_reference.fasta'

# Create an instance of the Nanolyse class
nanolyser = Nanolyse(input_reads = input_file, reference = reference_genome)

# Run Nanolyse
nanolyser.run()
```

Please note that the reference genome must be the Lambda Phage genome. Also, it should be in a FASTA file and located in the same directory as the script. The output file 'reads_Lambda_filtered.fastq' will be generated in the same directory.

To run this script, save it as 'nanolysis.py' and run it from the terminal:

```bash
python nanolysis.py
```

This will remove all the Lambda Phage reads from the input FASTQ file and generate a new FASTQ file with the remaining reads.
