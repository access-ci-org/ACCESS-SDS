Use Case: The R-XML library in R provides functions for the structural manipulation of XML documents. Use cases include data mining, data transformation, etc.

Code details and examples: Code

1. Reading an XML document into a tree structure:

``` 
library(XML)
mydoc <- xmlTreeParse("mydoc.xml")
```

In the above snippet, "mydoc.xml" is a sample XML input file to be parsed. The format required for the XML file is as per XML standard, i.e., proper nesting of tags, attribute-value pairs within tags, etc.

2. Extracting elements from the XML tree:

```
rootnode <- xmlRoot(mydoc)
first_child <- xmlChildren(rootnode)[[1]]
```

Here, xmlRoot function is used to get the root of the XML document and xmlChildren is used to access the child nodes.

3. Creating an XML document:

```
newdoc <- xmlTree()
newdoc$addTag("sample", "Hello, World!", close = TRUE)
```

In the above code, xmlTree() creates an empty XML document and the addTag function is used to add tags to the XML document.

Command to run the script (assuming it is saved as script.R on the command line):

```
Rscript script.R
```
