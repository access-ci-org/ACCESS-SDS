Use Case: R-SP is used for performing a variety of tasks in spatial data analysis, such as importing/exporting spatial data, manipulating spatial objects, and conducting spatial operations. 

Code Details and Examples:

1. Importing spatial data
```R
library(sp)
# load North Carolina map data in R
data(meuse)
coordinates(meuse) = ~x+y
plot(meuse)
```

2. Spatial operations - calculating the area of polygons
```R
library(raster)
# create a SpatialPolygons object
sp <- SpatialPolygons(list(Polygons(list(Polygon(cbind(c(2,4,4,1,2),c(2,3,5,4,2)))), 's1'),
Polygons(list(Polygon(cbind(c(5,4,2,5),c(2,3,2,2)))), 's2')))

# calculate area
area(sp)
```

Command to run - In RStudio or any other R-environment, code snippets need to be run in the console line by line.
