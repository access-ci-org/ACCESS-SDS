Use case: Use OpenJDK to run a Java program

Code details and examples: Code 

1. Java Program (Sample.java)

Sample Java code (Sample.java) file:

```java
public class Sample {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		System.out.println("Hello, World!");
	}
}
```

The input file here is Sample.java and it follows the standard java file syntax. It has a public class which contains a main method. The println method inside main is used to output text to the console.

2. Command to Compile

Open a terminal in the same directory as the java file and run the following command:

```bash
javac Sample.java
```

This command tells OpenJDK's compiler (javac) to compile the Java code in the Sample.java file. No additional specifications are required for the input file other than it being a valid java file.

3. Command to Run

After compiling successfully, an output file Sample.class is generated. This is a bytecode file that Java can run. Running the java file:

```bash
java Sample
```

This command tells OpenJDK's Java runtime (java) to run the bytecode in the Sample.class file. The java command followed by the filename excluding the .class extension is all that's required for OpenJDK's runtime. 

Output:

```
Hello, World!
```
