```
Category1, 10
Category2, 30
Category3, 20
```

Code Snippet:
```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd
from PlotSr import PlotSr

# Read data file
data_file = "sample_data.txt"
data_df = pd.read_csv(data_file, sep=",", header=None)

# Initialize PlotSr object
ps = PlotSr()

# Plot barchart
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ps.barplot(ax, data_df, x_index=0, y_index=1)
plt.show()
```

Command to run:
```bash
python plot_sr.py
