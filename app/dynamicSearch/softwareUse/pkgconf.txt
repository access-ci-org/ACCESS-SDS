Use Case: pkgconf is a program which helps to configure compiler and linker flags for development frameworks. It is generally used for compiling and linking against one or more libraries or frameworks.

Code details and examples: Code

1. Sample Configuration File: `libfoo.pc`
```
prefix=/usr
exec_prefix=${prefix}
libdir=${exec_prefix}/lib
includedir=${prefix}/include

Name: libfoo
Description: Foo library
Version: 1.0.0
Libs: -L${libdir} -lfoo
Cflags: -I${includedir}/foo
```
In this example, `libfoo.pc` is a package config file needed as an input by pkgconf. It provides metadata about a library. The metadata can contain the version of the library, compiler and linker flags required to use it, and dependency information.

2. Using The pkg-config File
```sh
gcc -o outputfile `pkgconf --cflags --libs libfoo` inputfile.c
```
In this command, pkgconf is used to get the compiler and linker flags required to compile and link against libfoo. `--cflags` returns the compiler flags needed and `--libs` returns the linker flags needed. The back-ticks(`) run the command before the compile process.

This is a shorthand way to specify the total compile command without the developer having manually list where the compiler and linking has to be performed.
