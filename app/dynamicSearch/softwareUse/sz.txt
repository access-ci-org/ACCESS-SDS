Use Case: SZ is an error-bounded lossy compression library that is designed to compress scientific data, particularly floating-point data types. The high compression ratio and fast speed of SZ make it attractive for use in high-performance computing applications where storage resources may be limited.

Code details and examples:

Code:

```python
import sz
import numpy as np

# Create some example data
data = np.arange(1000, dtype='float32')

# Compress the data with an error bound of 1.0E-3 
compressed = sz.compress(data, abs_err_bound=1.0E-3) 

# The resulting compressed data is a bytes object
print(type(compressed))  # <class 'bytes'>

# Decompress the data
decompressed = sz.decompress(compressed)

# The decompressed data is a numpy array
print(type(decompressed))  # <class 'numpy.ndarray'>
```

If using it via command line the SZ software can be executed like this:

```bash
./sz -z -f -i inputfile -1 dimension_size > outputfile.sz

# The options utilized here are:
# -z which stands for compress operation
# -f meaning single-precision floating point data in the file
# -i stands for input
# -1 stands for one dimensional array.

```
The input file would be any raw binary file made up of single-precision floating point data. Dimension sizes must be known and provided. The output file will contain the compressed form of the input data.
