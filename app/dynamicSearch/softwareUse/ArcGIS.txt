Use Case: Use ArcGIS to perform geospatial analysis and data management. 

Code details and examples: Code 

Input file: Esri Shapefile, a popular geospatial vector data format (.shp)

Specifications in input file: The .shp file contains the geometry for features. For instance, a shapefile of a forest might contain the boundaries and types of different vegetation.

Sample Input: Forest.shp

```python
import arcpy
from arcpy import env

# Set the workspace
env.workspace = "/path/to/directory"

# Set a variable for the total number of records
totalRecords = 0

# Use a for loop to count the total number of records
for dirpath, dirnames, filenames in arcpy.da.Walk():
    for filename in filenames:
        # Use a search cursor to find the number of records for each file
        with arcpy.da.SearchCursor(os.path.join(dirpath, filename), "*") as cursor:
            # Add the number of records in the current file to the total
            totalRecords += sum(1 for row in cursor)
print("The total number of records is: " + str(totalRecords))
```

The command to run the above Python file depends on how Python is installed and set up on your system. A typical command to run a Python file in a terminal is: `python filepath/script.py`
