Use Case: climetlab is a Python-based library by ECMWF (European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts) for visualization and data processing. climetlab helps to read, process, and visualize meteorological, oceanographic, and atmospheric datasets. 

Code details and examples: 

Code: 

```python
import climetlab as cml

# Reading data
ds = cml.load_dataset('era5-temperature-at-2m')  

# Processing data
ds.to_xarray()  

# Visualizing data
cml.plot_map(ds)
```

The dataset 'era5-temperature-at-2m' is a built-in dataset in climetlab and it does not require any input file. The processing is to convert the data to an xarray dataset which is a standard format for multi-dimensional data in Python. Finally, we plot the data on a map. 

Running the program command: This is not applicable for Python libraries. Run the python program containing the code mentioned above. Just ensure that python environment has the climetlab package installed.
