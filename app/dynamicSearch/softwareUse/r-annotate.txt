Use Case: Use r-annotate to analyze the genes associated with each weighted KEGG pathway and also to evaluate the statistical significance of the association between the genes and the weighted KEGG pathway.

Code details and examples: Code

The input file required for r-annotate is a comma-separated file (CSV) with gene lists (gene symbols).

Example input file (genes.csv):

```
GeneSymbol
BRCA1
BRCA2
TP53
EGFR
```

R Script to use R-Annotate:

```R
# Load the necessary libraries
require('annotate')
require('org.Hs.eg.db')

# Read the gene list
genes <- read.csv("genes.csv", header = TRUE)

# Get the Entrez IDs of the genes using the org.Hs.eg.db package 
EntrezIDs <- unlist(mget(genes$GeneSymbol, org.Hs.egSYMBOL2EG))

# Generate a basic annotation
basicAnnot <- basicAnnot(EntrezIDs)

# Print the basic annotation
print(basicAnnot)
```

Command to run: The above code can be run in an R environment. Save the script as r_annotate.r and the command to run it is:

```R
Rscript r_annotate.r
```

Specifications: The input file contains a header named "GeneSymbol" followed by symbols of genes of interest. It accepts gene symbols which will be converted to Entrez IDs using the org.Hs.eg.db R package. The script then generates a basic annotation of the gene list using the R-Annotate package.
