Use Case: Generating random numbers using a specific distribution

Code details and examples: The R package "dorng" is useful for generating random numbers according to a specified distribution.

For example, let's say we want to generate random numbers according to a normal distribution.

Code:

```R
# We first have to install and load the library
install.packages('dorng')
library(dorng)

# Set the seed for reproducibility
set.seed(123)

# Specify the distribution we want (normal), and the other necessary parameters
r <- dorng(distribution = 'norm', mean = 0, sd = 1, n = 100)

# This will generate 100 random numbers from a normal distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation 1.
```

Command to run:

This code can be run directly in the R console or using an IDE such as RStudio. If running from the command line, the R script should be saved as "filename.R". The command to run this file would then be `Rscript filename.R`. The function `set.seed(123)` is used to ensure that the random numbers generated are reproducible.
