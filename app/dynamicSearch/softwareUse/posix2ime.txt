Use Case: Posix2ime is a python library that allows for the conversion of time expressed in seconds since the Epoch (also known as POSIX time) to a more human readable format, with options for specifying timezone as well.

Code details and examples: 

Code:

```python
import posix2ime

# Convert POSIX time to human readable time
time_string = posix2ime.timespec(secs=1591619893, tz='PDT')
print(time_string)
```

This code snippet uses the posix2ime library to convert the POSIX time (1591619893) to a more human readable format, adjusted to 'PDT' timezone.

The format of the input file, if any, should include a list or an array of POSIX times separated with line breaks and saved as a txt or csv file.

Command to run (if used as script):

```console
python script.py
```
