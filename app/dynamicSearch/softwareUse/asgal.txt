Use Case: ASGAL (Alternative Splicing Graph ALigner) is an HPC software developed for the detection and the quantification of splicing events using RNA-Seq data. 

Code details and examples: 

Input files: ASGAL requires three input files which should be in specific formats:
1. A Repeat-Masked sequence file: It should be in FASTA format.
2. An Annotation file: It should be in GTF/GFF3 format providing the genomic annotation of every single exon/intron.
3. Alignment file: It should be in SAM/BAM format coming from a previously performed RNA-Seq alignment.

Example of commands:
```
asgal
--fasta /path/to/genome.fa 
--gtf /path/to/annotation.gtf 
--bam /path/to/alignment.bam 
--outDir /path/result/
```

Here, "--fasta" specifies the genome sequence, "--gtf" specifies the annotations, "--bam" specifies the aligned RNA sequence file, and "--outDir" is the directory to store the output.

Typically, the output gives a list of predicted splicing events.

Further, the ASGAL output can be run with code like this for splicing estimation:

```
./ase -i /path/to/ASGAL/results/ouput/AS_Event.tsv -o /path/to/output/CSV -f /path/to/fastq
```

Here, "ase" is to process the alignment by event, "-i" is used to specify the input file, "-o" is for the final output file and "-f" is the path to the FASTQ file of the RNA-Seq data.

NOTE:
- Alignment, if not already done, must be prepared as per the software's specific guidelines.
- Paths specified as "/path/to..." must be replaced by actual path where file resides.
