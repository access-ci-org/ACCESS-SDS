Use Case: Use Rstudio for statistical data analysis and visual representation.

Code details and examples: Code

Sample Input File:
A CSV file with three columns: `Name`, `Age`, `Salary`.

```csv
Name,Age,Salary
John,24,50000
Jane,32,64000
Bob,29,48000
```

RStudio generally operates on objects; these objects could be vectors (numeric, character, or logical), matrices, data frames, lists, etc. Typically, the user will load data into an object from an external source, such as a CSV file. Here's a brief illustration of how this might be done:

```r
# Load the data into a dataframe.
data <- read.csv("your_data_file.csv")

# Display the summary statistics of the dataframe.
summary(data)

# Using the ggplot2 library for visual representation
library(ggplot2)

# Plotting the data in a scatter plot
ggplot(data, aes(x=Age, y=Salary)) + 
  geom_point(shape=1) +    # Use hollow circles
  geom_smooth(method=lm,   # Add linear regression line
              se=FALSE)    # Don't add shaded confidence region
```

Command to run this:

Open RStudio -> Open the script file -> Click on the 'Run' button or press Ctrl+Enter to run line by line. 

Please replace the "your_data_file.csv" with the actual path and name of your dataset when using the read.csv function.

Note: RStudio is case sensitive, so ensure the correct case is used when entering commands.
