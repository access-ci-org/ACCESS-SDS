Use Case: Udunits is a scientific software typically used for handling units of physical quantities. The primary use case is converting data between different units. The software library provides support for units of physical quantities such as time, length, mass, heat, and others.

Code details and examples: Code

In typical use, we first create a `udunits2` system. This represents a collection of unit information, from which units can be created and various manipulations can be done. The `udunits2.txt` file should be present in your work directory.

```c
#include <udunits2.h>

int main() {
  ut_system* system;
  cv_converter* converter;
  ut_unit* source;
  ut_unit* target;
  
  system = ut_read_xml(NULL);
  source = ut_parse(system, "meters", UT_ASCII); 
  target = ut_parse(system, "feet", UT_ASCII);
  
  converter = ut_get_converter(source, target);
  
  printf("10 meters is %f feet\n", cv_convert_double(converter, 10));
}
```

This C code creates a udunits2 system, creates units of meters and feet, then a converter to convert from meters to feet, and finally does a conversion.

Compiling this C code typically done with gcc might look something like this:

`gcc -o converter converter.c -ludunits2`

and running it with something like this:

`./converter`
