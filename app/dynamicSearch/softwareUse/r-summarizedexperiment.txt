Use Case: SummarizedExperiment is an R package that is famously used in bioinformatics for managing the data of large-scale experiments with multiple variables. The data typically arranged with rows as samples, and columns as examples or vice versa, may require associations of multiple data attributes in complex experimental setups. SummarizedExperiment provides an efficient way to manage these data.

Code details and examples:

The R SummarizedExperiment package is part of the Bioconductor project and is widely used in bioinformatics. The following example demonstrates how to create a SummarizedExperiment object.

Code:

```R
# Load the required package
require(SummarizedExperiment)

# Use the example data from Airway package
require(Airway)

data("airway")
airway

# Generate a SummarizedExperiment object
se <- SummarizedExperiment(
  assays = list(counts = assay(airway)),
  rowData = rowData(airway),
  colData = colData(airway)
)

# Print the generated object
print(se)
```

To run this, you use the command `Rscript filename.R` where filename.R is the name of the R script file. 

In the above example, the Airway study data from the Airway package is loaded and used to create a SummarizedExperiment object. The specifics of the input format will depend on the requirements of the specific assays and meta-data being used to construct the SummarizedExperiment object. The input files can be in the form of CSV files, or the data can be pulled from other packages like in this example. 

The constructed object is then printed to the console. R script files are typically run from command line in Unix/Linux platforms with the `Rscript` command followed by the script file name. Appropriate permissions must be granted to the file for the execution.
