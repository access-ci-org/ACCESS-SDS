Use Case: GNU parallel is a shell tool for executing jobs in parallel using one or more computers. A job can be a single command or a small script that has to be run for each of the lines in the input.

To use GNU Parallel for running a task/job like converting a group of .png images into .jpg, we can use something like this. We have images named as image1.png, image2.png, etc.

Input file: input.txt (simple text file containing names of these images)
Format required: Text, one record per line

content in input.txt:

    image1.png
    image2.png
    image3.png

Running the parallel process can be started with this command:

      parallel convert {} {.}.jpg ::: *.png

In the above command, `{}` will be replaced by each line of input (i.e., the name of each image file), and `{.}` will be replaced by the line of input sans the file extension. `:::` specifies where input values are sourced from, in this case, all .png files.

Parallel makes it very straightforward to split these tasks across multiple cores or even machines. No input specifications or script required.
