Use Case: The `gtable` package in R is used for arranging `grobs` (graphics objects) in a specified layout. It is often used as part of the `ggplot2` package to alter the layout of figures.

Code Details and Examples:

First, you need to create a new graphic table - gtable

Code:

```R
library(gtable)

gt <- gtable(widths = unit(1:3, "cm"), heights = unit(4:1, "cm"))
```

Then, let's add some grobs with the `gtable_add_grob` function. Here's an example using points and lines:

Code:

```R
gt <- gtable_add_grob(gt, pointsGrob(), 1, 2)
gt <- gtable_add_grob(gt, linesGrob(), 2, 3)
grid.draw(gt)
```

To show the layout of your grobs within the gtable, you can use the `gtable_show_layout` function:

Code:

```R
gtable_show_layout(gt)
```

Running these codes will give you information about the coordinates and positioning of the `grobs` and will draw the graphics in your RStudio plot window.

There isn't any exact input file for gtable, as it works with functions from R itself or from other libraries. So the specification for input is just an R object that you assign these functions to work with in your code. The command to run the software package is just running the R script file with these codes.
