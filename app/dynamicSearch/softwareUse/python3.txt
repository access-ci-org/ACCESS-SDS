Use Case: Fundamental mathematical operations, string manipulations, and data management. 

Code details and examples: 

1. Fundamental mathematical operation:

Code:
```python
# Addition
num1 = 5
num2 = 3
add = num1 + num2
print('The sum of {} and {} is {}'.format(num1, num2, add))

# Subtraction
sub = num1 - num2
print('The difference of {} and {} is {}'.format(num1, num2, sub))

# Multiplication
mul = num1 * num2
print('The product of {} and {} is {}'.format(num1, num2, mul))

# Division
div = num1 / num2
print('The division of {} and {} is {}'.format(num1, num2, div))
```
Run this by using the command: `python math_operations.py`

2. String manipulation:

Code:
```python
# String concatenation
str1 = 'Hello'
str2 = ', World!'
concat = str1 + str2
print('Concatenated string is: {}'.format(concat))

# String slicing
name = 'Alice'
first_three_chars = name[:3]
print('First three characters in the name are: {}'.format(first_three_chars))
```
Run this by using the command: `python string_manipulation.py`

3. Data management:

Code:
```python
# Making a list
fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
print('The list of fruits is: ', fruits)

# Adding to a list
fruits.append('durian')
print('The updated list of fruits is: ', fruits)

# Removing from a list
fruits.remove('banana')
print('The updated list of fruits is: ', fruits)

# Accessing elements in a list
print('The first fruit is: ', fruits[0])

# Changing elements in a list
fruits[1] = 'blueberry'
print('The updated list of fruits is: ', fruits)

# Sorting a list
fruits.sort()
print('The sorted list of fruits is: ', fruits)
```
Run this by using the command: `python data_management.py`
