Use Case: Use Iq-tree for conducting phylogenetic analysis and computing maximum-likelihood trees; Using a DNA sequence alignment file as input.

Code details and examples: Code

Input File: Nexus or Phylip file formatted DNA/RNA/Protein sequence alignment. 

Example File: 

- A nexus file ("example.nex")

```
#NEXUS

BEGIN DATA;
DIMENSIONS NTAX=4 NCHAR=13;
FORMAT DATATYPE=DNA MISSING=N GAP=-;
MATRIX
Taxon1  AAGCTTCACCGTG
Taxon2  AAGCTTCACCGTT
Taxon3  TAGTTCACATGTG
Taxon4  CAGTTCACATCTT
;
END;
```

Command to run Iq-tree:

- The command and an argument is as follows. This is based on the availability of 8 cores, and outputs a tree file titled "example.treefile" based on the input "example.nex".

```
iqtree -s example.nex -nt 8
```

This will produce a maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree based on the sequence alignment.

Some other specifications and details in input files:

 - For Phylip file format, it should be as per the standard Phylip format. The first line contains two integers: the number of species, and the number of characters. Each of the following lines contain a species name (up to 10 characters), followed by its sequence (which may continue onto subsequent lines).

 - IQ-TREE allows for a range of other command line arguments to customize the phylogenetic analysis, including model test, ultrafast bootstrap, SH-aLRT branch test, etc. 

 - Output formats include several supported tree formats, log file, checkpoint file, etc. 

 - IQ-TREE also supports multi-threading, so the "-nt" command can be adjusted based on how many cores are available for running the program.

Note: It is very important to manually inspect the output tree and the output log to ensure that the results are as expected and no errors occurred during analysis.
