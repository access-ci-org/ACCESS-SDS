Use Case: LVM2 (Logical Volume Manager 2) is a tool for managing logical volumes, or compiling groups of hard drives into one large virtual disk. It allows for more flexibility with volume sizing as it abstracts the physical layout of the disks and lets you resize volumes as needed. 

Code details and examples: Code

Suppose you have two hard drives sda and sdb and you want to create a logical volume named myVolume, the commands would generally look like this:

1. Create the physical volumes:

    ```
    pvcreate /dev/sda /dev/sdb
    ```

2. Create the volume group:

    ```
    vgcreate myVolumeGroup /dev/sda /dev/sdb
    ```

3. Create the logical volume:

    ```
    lvcreate -n myVolume -l 100%FREE myVolumeGroup
    ```

This will create a single logical volume using all of the available space on the two drives. 

To list all your physical volumes you can use `pvdisplay`, to list all volume groups `vgdisplay`, to list all logical volumes `lvdisplay`. 

You can easily extend your logical volume if you add a new physical volume to the volume group:

    ```
    pvcreate /dev/sdc
    vgextend myVolumeGroup /dev/sdc
    lvextend -l +100%FREE /dev/myVolumeGroup/myVolume
    ```

Note: The '+' sign before '100%FREE' tells lvextend to add the free space to the existing space, instead of setting the space to that amount. Always make sure to resize the filesystem to use the new space available:

    ```
    resize2fs /dev/myVolumeGroup/myVolume
    ```

Be cautious while using LVM (or any disk-related) commands, mishandling can lead to data losses. Always ensure to back up essential data and carefully check your commands before execution.

These commands need to be run as superuser so you may precede commands with `sudo` or run as root user. This software usually comes pre-installed with most Linux operating systems.
