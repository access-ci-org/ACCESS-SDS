Use Case: Use mdtest to benchmark a file system.

Code details and examples: Code

mdtest, a metadata benchmark tool, operates on files and directories. This tool uses POSIX commands to test the file system performance.

Mdtest allows file creation, stat, read, and removal tests for sequential and random operations, measuring the IOPS and throughput.

Sample Input File Creation Command:

```
$ mdtest -n 1000 -u -F
```

In the above command,
    
-n 1000 : means 1000 files/directories will be created by each task (it's the number of items per directory in the tree)

-u : means unique working directories for tasks

-F : means file tests only, no directories.

Running mdtest:

```
$ mpirun -np 4 mdtest -d /tmp -i 10 -y
```

In the above command, 
    
-np 4 : Means you're running the test on 4 processors.
    
-d /tmp : means that you're doing the test in the /tmp directory.
    
-i 10 : means that you are doing 10 iterations of the test.
    
-y : signifies to sync the file system after each operation.

The results would be printed to the terminal upon completion of the tests. These will include metrics like number of files/directories created, removed in the file system, and number of statistical checks on file/directory done with their corresponding times recorded.
