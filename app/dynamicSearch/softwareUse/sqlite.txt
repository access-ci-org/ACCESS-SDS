Use Case: Sqlite can be used in applications where a local lightweight database is required that runs on the disk. It can be run with a SQL interface that executes SQL queries and returns results.

Code details and examples: 

Code: 

```python
import sqlite3
from sqlite3 import Error

def create_connection():
    conn = None;
    try:
        conn = sqlite3.connect(':memory:') # create a database in RAM 
        print(sqlite3.version)
    except Error as e:
        print(e)
        
    if conn:
        conn.close()


if __name__ == '__main__':
    create_connection()
```

This is a simple example of how to interact with SQLITE in Python.
