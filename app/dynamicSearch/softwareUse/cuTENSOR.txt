Use Case: cuTENSOR is a first-of-its-kind, GPU-accelerated tensor linear algebra library that allows software developers to perform tensor contractions and reductions at the speed of GPUs.

Code details and examples: Code

To use cuTENSOR, you'll need code that defines your tensor data and handles. For instance, here's a basic sample using single-precision complex numbers (Complex float). Let's assume we have three complex float tensors A, B, and C with the same dimensions (3, 3, 3).

Input files:

# Include the cuTENSOR header
```cpp
#include <cutensor/cutensor.h>
```

```cpp
cutensorHandle_t handle;
cutensorCreate(&handle);

uint32_t rankA = 3;
uint32_t extentA[3] = {3, 3, 3};
cuComplex* A_d;
cudaMalloc((void**)&A_d, sizeof(cuComplex) * extentA[0] * extentA[1] * extentA[2]);

uint32_t rankB = 3;
uint32_t extentB[3] = {3, 3, 3};
cuComplex* B_d;
cudaMalloc((void**)&B_d, sizeof(cuComplex) * extentB[0] * extentB[1] * extentB[2]);

uint32_t rankC = 3;
uint32_t extentC[3] = {3, 3, 3};
cuComplex* C_d;
cudaMalloc((void**)&C_d, sizeof(cuComplex) * extentC[0] * extentC[1] * extentC[2]);
```

To execute a tensor operation, you'd first define the tensor descriptors and fill them with your chosen data:

```cpp
cutensorTensorDescriptor_t descA;
cutensorCreateTensorDescriptor(&handle, &descA, rankA, extentA, NULL, CUDA_C_32F, CUTENSOR_OP_IDENTITY);

cutensorTensorDescriptor_t descB;
cutensorCreateTensorDescriptor(&handle, &descB, rankB, extentB, NULL, CUDA_C_32F, CUTENSOR_OP_IDENTITY);

cutensorTensorDescriptor_t descC;
cutensorCreateTensorDescriptor(&handle, &descC, rankC, extentC, NULL, CUDA_C_32F, CUTENSOR_OP_IDENTITY);
```

Then, to perform the contractions, you'd use the cuTensorContraction API as such:

```cpp
cutensorContractionDescriptor_t desc;
cutensorInitContractionDescriptor(&handle, &desc,
                                  &descA, "ijk", &descB, "ijk", &descC, "ijk",
                                  &descC, "ijk", COMPLEX_ACCUMULATE);
```
This code will perform the contraction of tensors A and B, and accumulate the result into tensor C.

Command to run: Provided that you have the CUDA SDK, NVCC compiler, and cuTENSOR properly installed and set up, typical commands to compile and run a cuTENSOR code can end in:
```
nvcc -I/path/to/cutensor/include -L/path/to/cutensor/lib64 -lcutensor -lcudart -o sample sample.cu
./sample
```
The "/path/to/cutensor" would be the path where you have cuTENSOR installed. The -I and -L flags specify the include and library paths respectively for the NVCC compiler. The -l flags specify the libraries to link against. You would compile your file (here named "sample.cu") with `nvcc` and then run the compiled executable named "sample".
