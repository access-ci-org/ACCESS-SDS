Use Case: Snappy is a python library for 2D/3D graphics and is commonly used for automating the generation of geospatial data interfaces. These data can include satellite images or other landscape data. You can use it to create, get, manipulate or execute operations on the images.

Code details and examples: Code.

First, we need to import the snappy module:
```python
from snappy import ProductIO
```

A typical use case might involve loading a satellite image:

```python
product = ProductIO.readProduct('path_to_your_image.dim')
```

You can check the names of the bands:

```python
list(product.getBandNames())
```

Or get a specific Band:

```python
band = product.getBand('band_name')
```

Extract width and height of the band:

```python
width = band.getRasterWidth()
height = band.getRasterHeight()
```

You can also get the data array of the whole raster data or subset of it:

```python
data = band.readPixels(x, y, w, h, None)
```

Or you can save the product back after manipulation:

```python
ProductIO.writeProduct(product, 'path_to_output_file.dim', 'BEAM-DIMAP')
```

For these codes, you need an image file ('path_to_your_image.dimâ€™) in BEAM-DIMAP format (Developed by Brockmann Consult), which is the native format for satellite products in SNAP (ESA Sentinel Application Platform) where snappy is derived from.

## Warning!! ##
Pay attention to handle the image data carefully. The raster data can be more than 10 GB so it might consume too much memory if not handled properly.
