Use Case: The Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV) is a high-performance viewer that can be used for interactive exploration of large, integrated datasets. It provides real-time visualization of multiple sample types, such as genomic data, RNA-Seq, structural variations, and others.

Code details and examples:

Code:

To load a genome in the IGV, you can use a simple text file called a .genome file. This file defines the genome sequence, chromosome lengths, cytoband file, and optionally, URLs for downloading sequence data. Each line in the file follows the format name=value. Here is an example .genome file:

```
id=hg19
name=Human hg19
sequence=/path/to/sequence.fasta
cytoband=/path/to/cytoband.txt
chromSizes=/path/to/chrom.sizes

```

To load this genome, open the IGV software and select `Genomes -> Load Genome from File...`

Next, to load a track data file, simply select `File -> Load from File...` and choose your data file (.bam, .vcf, .bed, etc).

**Note**: The IGV commands for running are generally performed over a GUI and not typically executed over command line.

The input data files, like .bam, .vcf, .bed, etc., vary in format but they can be generalized as below:

1. BAM format: Binary version of SAM, a sequence alignment map format.

2. VCF format: It is a format for storing gene sequence variations.

3. BED format: It defines a feature (a specific region or regions) in the genome.
Example:

```
chr22  1000  5000  cloneA  960  +
chr22  2000  6000  cloneB  900  -
chr22  3000  7000  cloneC  760  +
chr22  4000  8000  cloneD  700  +
chr22  5000  9000  cloneE  600  +
chr22  6000 10000  cloneF  500  +
chr22  7000 15000  cloneG  100  +
```
Each field is separated by a whitespace and the columns represent chrom, chromStart, chromEnd, name, score, strand respectively. This is just one way of representing a BED format, there might be additional fields.

Command to run them:

The IGV software is typically interacted with via a GUI and does not have command line commands for general use. However, it can be launched from the command line with a command similar to: 

`igv.sh -g hg19 filename.vcf`
