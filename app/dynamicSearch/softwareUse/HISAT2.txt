Use Case: HISAT2 is a fast and sensitive alignment program which is used for mapping next-generation sequencing reads (both DNA and RNA) to a population of human genomes (as well as to a single reference genome).

Code Details and Examples:

Code:

Input file required: Two FASTQ or a single BAM file

Here is a sample commands to align paired end RNA-seq reads to the human genome:

```bash
hisat2 -p 8 -x /path_to_your_index/hg38 --dta -1 read1.fastq -2 read2.fastq -S sample.sam
```

In this example, '-p 8' tells HISAT2 to use 8 processor cores to achieve multithreading. The '-x' option points HISAT2 to the basename of the index for the reference genome (`/path_to_your_index/hg38`). 

The '--dta' option tells HISAT2 that this is RNA-seq data and the result will be used for a downstream transcript assembler (e.g., StringTie). 

The '-1' and '-2' options point to the two FASTQ files for the paired end reads. 

The '-S' option points HISAT2 to where to write the SAM file output (`sample.sam`) which will contain the alignments.

There are several options, settings, and specifications that one can use in HISAT2 which are detailed in its manual. Always check the manual for the most accurate and detailed information.
