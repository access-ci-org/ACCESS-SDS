Use Case: Profiling and detailed analysis of program execution in high-performance computing.

Code details and examples:

Let's consider we have an application named `bigImageAnalysis` compiled with `-g` option for debugging and profiling. 

Code: 

```C++
$ tau_cc.sh -g -o bigImageAnalysis bigImageAnalysis.cpp
```

Input file: No specific input file is required for Pdtoolkit as it analyzes a compiled program. 

Code: 

Profiling execution of `bigImageAnalysis` with Tau:

```bash
$ tau_exec -T serial ./bigImageAnalysis
```

Output of this execution will be a directory named `tau-profile-files` containing a group of profile.*.*.* files. You can then analyze the performance of your application with the `paraprof` utility.

```bash
$ paraprof
```

Command to run Pdtoolkit: Pdtoolkit runs with the compiled application. Hence the compiled application ran with tau_exec is the command to run pdtoolkit. Here, the command is:

```bash
$ tau_exec -T serial ./bigImageAnalysis
```

Note: The code snippets and commands may vary depending on the build configuration of Pdtoolkit and its interaction with other software and tools.
