Use Case: GDRCopy is a user-level GPU memory management package that provides a simple GPU direct access (GDR) copy abstraction. It is mainly used to speed up inter-node communication in high performance computing (HPC) systems by leveraging GPU direct RDMA technology.

Code details and Examples:
Code:

In order to use GDRCopy, you need to have a CUDA program which manages the communication between the CPU and the GPU memory.

Here is a sample use case with a CUDA program:

```cpp
#include <cuda.h>
#include <gdrapi.h>

int main() {
    CUdeviceptr d_A;
    void *h_A;
    gdr_t g = gdr_open();
    CUdevice dev;
    CUcontext ctx;

    cuInit(0);
    cuDeviceGet(&dev, 0);
    cuCtxCreate(&ctx, 0, dev);

    size_t size = 1024 * 1024 * 1024;
    cuMemAlloc(&d_A, size);
    gdr_mh_t mh;
    gdr_pin_buffer(g, d_A, size, 0, 0, &mh);
  
    gdr_map(g, mh, &h_A, size);
    cudaMemcpy(d_A, h_A, size, cudaMemcpyDefault);

    gdr_unmap(g, mh, h_A, size);
    cuMemFree(d_A);
    gdr_close(g);

    return 0;
}
```

This sample CUDA program:
1. Initializes a CUDA device and context
2. Allocates GPU memory
3. Pins that memory with gdr_pin_buffer()
4. Maps it to a user-space pointer with gdr_map()
5. Copies data from the mapped pointer to the GPU memory with cudaMemcpy()
6. Then unmaps the memory and frees it

To run this program, you have to compile it with NVCC (NVIDIA CUDA Compiler) and run the output executable:

```bash
nvcc gdrcopy_sample.cu -o gdrcopy_sample -lgdrapi
./gdrcopy_sample
```

Note: The input in this package does not come from input files but from the memory management that is performed inside the source code of the program.
