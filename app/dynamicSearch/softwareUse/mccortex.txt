Use Case: McCortex is used to analyze genomic data using De Bruijn Graphs, often for identifying variation in genomes.

Code Details and Examples: 

Input Format Required:
1) A Fasta file containing DNA sequences.
2) A text file that contains a list of paths to sequence files.

Sample File:
Fasta File:

```text
>header
AGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTA...
>header2
AGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTT...
```
Text File:
```text
/directory/file1.fasta
/directory/file2.fasta
...

```
The Fasta files should contain DNA sequences under headers, and the text file should contain the paths to these Fasta files. 

Code to Create a Graph:
```bash
mccortex31 build --nkmers 50m --threads 4 --kmer 31 --mem 8G --sample MySample --seq2 /directory/mysample_1.fastq.gz,/directory/mysample_2.fastq.gz mysample.ctx
```
This will create a graph with a kmer-size of 31, using 4 threads and 8G of memory. It will expect the sample name "MySample", and the list of sequences came from "mysample_1.fastq.gz" and "mysample_2.fastq.gz".

Code to Merge Graphs:
```bash
mccortex31 join sample1.ctx sample2.ctx sample1_and_sample2.ctx
```
This will combine the graphs from two separate samples into one.

Note: Replace "31" with the number of hash table size, where the options are: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 29, 31. Make sure the expected RAM and disk space requirements are met before processing.
