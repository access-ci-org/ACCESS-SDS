Use Case: The ecCodes is primarily used for decoding and encoding of data in GRIB (General Regularly-distributed Information in Binary form) format which is used for storing historical weather forecast data and processing such data for climate studies.

Code details and examples:

Code for reading a GRIB File:

```
from eccodes import *
 
f = open('/data/era5.grib2')
while 1:
    gid = codes_grib_new_from_file(f)
    if gid is None:
        break
 
    print("GRIB edition      :", codes_get(gid, 'edition'))
    print("Grid type         :", codes_get(gid, 'gridType'))
    print("Number of points  :", codes_get_size(gid, 'values'))
    print("Average           :", codes_get(gid, 'average'))
    print("=======================")
 
    codes_release(gid)
f.close()
```

In this example, an input file in GRIB format is read and various parameters are extracted from it using the `codes_get` function. 

Command to run: 

`python read_grib.py`

The input file should be in the GRIB format and must contain fields such as 'edition', 'gridType', etc. to be read by this script.
