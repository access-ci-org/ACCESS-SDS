Use Case: Gengetopt is a tool to write command line option parsing code for C programs. It assists in creating a skeleton main.c containing code for parsing and validating command line options, which can then be filled in by the developer. 

Code details and examples: 

Code: 
 cmd-line.ggo file:

```
version "1.0"
package "demonstration"

option "help" h "Display this help and exit" flag off
option "output" o "Output to this file" string required
option "verbosity" v "Verbosity level" int default="0"
option "name" n "Insert a name" string default="Gengetopt"
option "include" I "Additional include directory" string array
```

Command to generate C files:

```
gengetopt < cmd-line.ggo
```

This will create cmdline.c and cmdline.h, which can be included in your C project.

Then, in your C code:

```
#include <stdio.h>
#include "cmdline.h"

int main (int argc, char **argv) {
  struct gengetopt_args_info args_info;

  if (cmdline_parser (argc, argv, &args_info) != 0)
    exit(1) ;

  printf ("Provide name is %s\n", args_info.name_arg);
  printf ("Verbosity level is %d\n", args_info.verbosity_arg);

  for (int i = 0; i < args_info.include_given; ++i)
    printf ("Include path %d is %s\n", i, args_info.include_arg[i]);

  cmdline_parser_free (&args_info);
}
```

To compile and run the program:

```
gcc main.c cmdline.c -o main
./main --name "Gengetopt" --verbosity 5
```
