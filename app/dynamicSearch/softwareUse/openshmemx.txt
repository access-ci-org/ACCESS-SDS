Use Case: HPC software

Code details and examples:

**OpenSHMEM** is a programming interface used for partitioned global address space parallel programming. OpenSHMEM is typically used in high-performance computing for parallel programming on distributed memory systems.

Here is an example of a simple OpenSHMEM program written in C:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <shmem.h>

int main(void) {
    int my_pe, npes;

    shmem_init();
    my_pe = shmem_my_pe();
    npes = shmem_n_pes();
    
    printf("Hello from PE %d out of %d\n", my_pe, npes);

    shmem_finalize();
    return 0;
}
```

To compile this program using OpenSHMEM, you can use the following command (assuming your program is saved in a file named `hello.c`):

```
oshcc hello.c -o hello
```

And to run the compiled program, you can use a command like this:

```
mpirun -np 4 ./hello
```

This will run the program with 4 parallel processes.
