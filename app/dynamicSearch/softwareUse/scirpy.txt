Use Case: Scirpy is a Python library that is used for analyzing single-cell T-cell receptor sequencing data. It works best when the target files are in the Anndata format, specifically the .h5ad type.

Code Details and Examples:

Code:

```python
# Import the necessary libraries
import scirpy as ir
import scanpy as sc

# Read the data file
adata = sc.read("/path/to/your/datafile.h5ad")

# Run the preprocessing
ir.pp.ir_dist(adata, metric = "jaccard")

# Run the clustering
ir.tl.define_complementarity_groups(adata)

# Visualize the results
ir.pl.complementarity_group(adata)
```

For this example, you would need a .h5ad file, which is most commonly generated through the Scanpy library. This file includes matrix arrays, graphs, annotations, and dimensions. Note that "/path/to/your/datafile.h5ad" needs to be replaced with the specific path to your data file.

The command to run this script depends on your Python execution setup. For example, if you are running this script from a Python interactive shell or Jupyter notebook, you can simply use the `run` command followed by the file name. If you are running this script from the terminal, you can use the `python` command followed by the script name.
