Use Case: Connecting to a remote database using R-DBI to perform data analysis.

Code details and examples:

Code:

```R
library(DBI)

# Connect to a remote PostgreSQL database
con <- dbConnect(RPostgres::Postgres(), 
                 dbname = "database_name", 
                 host = "host_url or IP_address", 
                 port = "port_number",
                 user = "username",
                 password = "password")

# Grab some data from a database and store it in an R data frame
data <- dbGetQuery(con, "SELECT * FROM schema.table_name")

# Disconnect from the database
dbDisconnect(con)
```
