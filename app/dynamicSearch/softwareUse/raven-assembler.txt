Use Case: Raven assembler is used for assembling long, error-prone reads produced by third-generation sequencing platforms. It can be used for de novo genome assembly of plant, animal, or microbial genomes.

Code details and examples:

Dataset:
Raven uses Fastq files as input. Fastq files record a DNA sequence and the corresponding quality scores. A Fastq file might look like this:

```
@SRR001666.1 071112_SLXA-EAS1_s_7:5:1:817:345 length=60
GGGTGATGGCCGCTGCCGATGGCGTCAAATCCCACCAAGTTACCCTTAACAACTTAAGGG
+SRR001666.1 071112_SLXA-EAS1_s_7:5:1:817:345 length=60
IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII9IG9ICIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIDIII
```

Each read consists of four lines:

1. Unique identifier of the read
2. DNA sequence
3. Delimiter (always a '+')
4. Quality scores for each base in the DNA sequence

Command:
To run the Raven assembler, use the command `raven` followed by the Fastq files that you want to assemble. For example, if you have a Fastq file named `reads.fastq`, you would run:

```
raven reads.fastq > assembly.fasta
```

This command produces a Fastq file named `assembly.fasta` that contains the assembled sequences.
