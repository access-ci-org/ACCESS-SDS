Use Case: Intel oneAPI is a toolkit that is used for developing high-performance and data-centric applications across diverse architectures. It contains compilers, libraries, analyzers, debuggers, and more. One of the key components is the DPC++ Compiler that enables developers to write applications once and deploy them across various hardware such as CPUs, GPUs, and FPGAs.

Code details and examples:

Code:
Let's assume you have a file called `vector_addition.cpp` which uses DPC++ to perform vector addition.

```cpp
#include <CL/sycl.hpp>
using namespace sycl;

int main() {
  queue q;
  std::cout << "Running on " << q.get_device().get_info<info::device::name>() << "\n";

  const int size = 1024;
  std::array<int, size> A, B, C;

  for(int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
    A[i] = i;
    B[i] = i*2;
  }

  {
    buffer<int, 1> bufferA(A.data(), A.size());
    buffer<int, 1> bufferB(B.data(), B.size());
    buffer<int, 1> bufferC(C.data(), C.size());

    q.submit([&](handler& h) {
      auto accessorA = bufferA.get_access<access::mode::read>(h);
      auto accessorB = bufferB.get_access<access::mode::read>(h);
      auto accessorC = bufferC.get_access<access::mode::write>(h);

      h.parallel_for<class vector_add>(range<1>(size), [=](id<1> i) {
        accessorC[i] = accessorA[i] + accessorB[i];
      });
    });
  }

  for(int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
    assert(C[i] == i + i*2);
  }

  std::cout << "Success\n";
  return 0;
}
```

To compile and run the above code, you will need to enter the following commands:

```
dpcpp vector_addition.cpp -o vector_addition
./vector_addition
```

The `dpcpp` command will compile the code and the `./vector_addition` command will run the resulting binary. Your terminal should then print the name of the device that is used and a success message if all elements in C are the sum of the corresponding elements in A and B as intended.
