Use Case: MCL (Markov Cluster algorithm) is software that clusters a network/graph into groups. It is widely used in bioinformatics for finding families in protein similarity networks.

Code details and examples: 

Code:

The MCL algorithm accepts an input in the simplest form of an edge list. This is an example edge list for a simple undirected graph:

1 2 0.2
1 3 0.8
2 3 0.6

This file must be named with a ".abc" extension. The format is that each line represents an edge, with the nodes being the first two numbers and the weight of the edge being the third. 

Before running the MCL algorithm, your graph must be processed into an MCL format using the "mcxload" command:

```$ mcxload -abc myGraph.abc --stream-mirror --stream-neg-log10 -stream-tf 'ceil(200)' -o myGraph.mci -write-tab myGraph.tab```

The resulting myGraph.mci file can then be processed with the MCL algorithm:

```$ mcl myGraph.mci -I 1.4```

This will output the clusters to stdout. You can direct this to a file by appending "> output.clusters" to the command: 

```$ mcl myGraph.mci -I 1.4 > output.clusters```

You can examine the clusters with the "mcxdump" command:

```$ mcxdump -icl output.clusters -tabr myGraph.tab -o dump```

This will output a user-friendly view of the clusters in dump.
