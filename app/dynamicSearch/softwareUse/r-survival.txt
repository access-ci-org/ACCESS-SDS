Use Case: r-survival is a highly used package in R for performing survival analysis, which is used to model time-to-event data, a concept which arises frequently in medical fields and other research areas where scientists are looking at how long it takes for an event of interest to occur.

Code details and examples: Code

Below is a simple example of how the r-survival package can be used to perform a survival analysis. This example uses the 'lung' dataset, which is available in R. The dataset is pre-processed and then a survival model is fitted using the 'survfit' function.

Input file format: CSV 
Specifications and details in input files: The required format for the input data is a dataframe with event times and censoring information included.

```
# Load the survival package
library(survival)

# Load the Lung Cancer dataset from the survival package
data("lung")

# We are interested in the 'time' to event and the 'status' (event occurred or not)
surv_object <- with(lung, Surv(time, status))

# Fit Kaplan-Meier survival model
surv_model <- survfit(surv_object ~ 1, data = lung)

# Print the model output
print(surv_model)
```

The command to run the script:

```
Rscript survival_analysis.R
```

This would be assuming that you saved your script as "survival_analysis.R" and you run this command in a terminal that has Rscript accessible. The name of the file can be changed based on your preference.

Note: This code example is for illustration purposes only and may need modification based on the actual data and analysis requirements.
