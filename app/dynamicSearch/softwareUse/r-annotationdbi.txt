Use case: Fetch mappings from different annotation sources

Code details and examples:

Code:

```R
library(AnnotationDbi)

# Load org.Hs.eg.db data
library(org.Hs.eg.db)

# Getting the list of keys
keggKeys <- keys(org.Hs.eg.db, keytype="KEGG")
print(keggKeys)

# Mapping
mapped <- select(org.Hs.eg.db, keggKeys, c("SYMBOL", "GENENAME"), "KEGG")
print(head(mapped))
```

In this example, the "org.Hs.eg.db" is a package that provides mappings between different annotation sources, such as symbols from KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) and UniProtKB, providing a plethora of gene-centric information, including gene symbol, gene name, Entrez Gene and Uniprot identifiers, NCBI taxonomy, etc. for Homo Sapiens (human).

The `keys` function is used to retrieve the list of keys (identifiers) that can be used to get the annotations for the loaded database. Here, KEGG keys are being fetched.

The `select` function is then used to fetch a set of attributes (`SYMBOL`, `GENENAME`) for a specified set of keys (`keggKeys`). The fourth parameter is the type of the keys that are being passed.

Run Command:

Typically, R scripts are executed in an interactive R session. Just paste the code into the R console and execute it. In case a user wants to run an R script via the command line, the following syntax is used: 

```bash
$ Rscript filename.R
```
