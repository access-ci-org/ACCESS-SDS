Use Case : Doxygen is used to generate documentation from source code in a very easy and convenient way. You can use it with practically any programming language like C++, Python, Java, etc. It can generate both HTML and LaTeX documentation.

Code details and examples:

Code:

For instance, let's consider the below C++ example.

```cpp
/*!
 * \brief Performs a division.
 * \param[in] numerator The numerator of the division.
 * \param[in] denominator The denominator of the division. Must not be zero.
 * \return The result of the division.
 * \throws std::invalid_argument If denominator is zero.
 */
double divide(double numerator, double denominator) {
    if (denominator == 0) {
    throw std::invalid_argument{"Denominator cannot be zero"};
    }
    return numerator / denominator;
}
```

To generate documentation for this code, Doxygen needs a configuration file that can easily generate using the below command:

```
doxygen -g
```

This creates a file called Doxyfile in your working directory. Now, you can run Doxygen on this configuration file to generate the documentation:

```
doxygen Doxyfile
```

The specific inputs here are the source codes for which the documentation has to be generated. The format required is just the source code files. A specific Doxyfile needs to be created to specify rules for the documentation. Then Doxygen should be run on this configuration file to produce the documentation.
