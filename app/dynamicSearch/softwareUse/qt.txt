Use Case: Use Qt for developing multi-platform applications and GUIs;

Code details and examples: Code

Below is a simple example of a Qt application in C++. An application in Qt is defined by subclassing QApplication, a GUI is built by subclassing a QWidget and a button can be created using QPushButton.

```c++
#include <QApplication>
#include <QPushButton>

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
 QApplication app (argc, argv);

 QPushButton button ("Hello world !");
 button.show();

 return app.exec();
}
```

To run this application, save it to a .cpp file, compile it with g++, and run the resulting executable. You'll need to have the Qt development libraries installed.

Compilation command: `g++ main.cpp -o app -lQt5Core -lQt5Gui -lQt5Widgets`
Running command: `./app`
