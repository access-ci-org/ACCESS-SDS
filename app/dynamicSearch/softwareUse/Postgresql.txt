Use Case: PostgreSQL is a powerful, open source object-relational database system. It can handle workloads ranging from small single-machine applications to large internet-facing applications with many concurrent users. 

Code Details and Examples: 

PostgreSQL sets a client_encoding for each client on connection. This poses a problem when data is input that is in a different encoding from set by the client. Here's how PostgreSQL deals with it.

First, ensure that PostgreSQL server accepts UTF-8:

    SHOW SERVER_ENCODING;

Also, ensure that your client accepts UTF-8:

    SHOW CLIENT_ENCODING;

If the client encoding is different, you can set the client encoding to UTF-8:

    SET CLIENT_ENCODING = 'UTF-8';

A simple SQL command can be run on PostgreSQL to create a database:

    CREATE DATABASE test;

A table in the database can be created as:

    CREATE TABLE users(id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, username VARCHAR(50), email VARCHAR(50));

The data can be entered into the table as:

    INSERT INTO users (username, email) VALUES ('tester1', 'tester1@gmail.com');

The command to run a SQL script file with the psql command line interface is:

    psql -f filename.sql

Here, filename.sql is the file with the SQL commands.
