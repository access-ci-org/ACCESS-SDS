Use Case: The Spliced Transcripts Alignment to a Reference (STAR) tool is extensively used in bioinformatics for aligning RNA-sequencing reads to a reference genome for downstream analysis.

Code details and examples: 

Input Files:
1. Reference genome: Specific to the organism being studied, typically in FASTA format.
2. Gene annotations: A GTF/GFF file that contains the known genes and their locations for the reference genome.
3. RNA-seq reads: Raw sequencing reads from the RNA-seq experiment, typically in FASTQ format.

Command to generate genome index (genomeDir is the directory storing the output files):

```
STAR --runMode genomeGenerate --genomeDir /path/to/genomeDir --genomeFastaFiles /path/to/genome.fasta --sjdbGTFfile /path/to/annotations.gtf --runThreadN [numThreads]
```

Command to align RNA-seq reads:

```
STAR --genomeDir /path/to/genomeDir --readFilesIn /path/to/read1.fastq /path/to/read2.fastq --runThreadN [numThreads] --outSAMtype BAM SortedByCoordinate --outFileNamePrefix /path/to/output
```

Specifications:
- Adjust `[numThreads]` to the number of threads you wish to use.
- For genome index generation, the genome FASTA file and the GTF file must correspond to the same version of the genome.
- For alignment, the RNA-seq reads can be single-end or paired-end; provide one file path for single-end or two file paths for paired-end.
