Use Case: Use of libpam to authenticate users in a Linux/Unix system.

Code details and examples: 

Code:

Firstly, configuration file for PAM will be created. Let's say we are creating this for "myapp".

/etc/pam.d/myapp

This is a file which needs to be created and below are the details that will be inside the file. 

```
#%PAM-1.0
auth       required     pam_unix.so
account    required     pam_unix.so
password   required     pam_unix.so
session    required     pam_unix.so
```

In a C program, PAM can be used for authentication. Create a file "myapp.c"

```C
#define PAM_SM_PASSWORD
#include <security/pam_modules.h>

PAM_EXTERN int
pam_sm_chauthtok(pam_handle_t *pamh, int flags, int argc, const char **argv)
{
    return PAM_SUCCESS;
}
```

To compile this code gcc compiler is used.

Command to compile and create an object file:
```
gcc -fPIC -c myapp.c
```

Command to create a shared library:
```
ld -x --shared -o myapp.so myapp.o
```

This will create myapp.so file which needs to be in the /lib/security directory.

After moving the file to /lib/security, you can use the "myapp" with any application that uses PAM for authentication.
