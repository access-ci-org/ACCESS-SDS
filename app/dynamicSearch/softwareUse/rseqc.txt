Use Case: RSeQC is an RNA-seq quality control package that gives users a rapid and comprehensive quality control report. In biology and familiar fields, it is employed for quality control in the RNA-seq data.

Code details and examples: 

Code: 
The input file for RSeQC is a BAM or SAM file, sort of alignments obtained from aligning sequencing reads to a reference genome.

Input file example:

```
HS2000-940_146:2:2307:18952:82214#49/1	99	chr1	13802	1	50M	=	13878	126	AGGGTTTTCCCATGATTGCGCGTGTTTCCGCTCCCCCCGTGGGGAGGAAGGA	BC@
```
The command to run the most common RSeQC scripts is simple:

`read_distribution.py -i input.bam -r hg19.bed > output.txt`

This command calculates the distribution of reads over features defined in the BED file. The result is outputted to the terminal and can be redirected to the file output.txt. 

In this command:

-i denotes the input BAM file.
-r denotes the reference BED file. 

Specifications and details in input files:

- The first column in the file should be 'chr' followed by chromosome number.
- The columns should be tab-separated.
- The file should have a.bam or .sam extension and be in the appropriate format.
- For paired end reads, the two reads should have identical names.
