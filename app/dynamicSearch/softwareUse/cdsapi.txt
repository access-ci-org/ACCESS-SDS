Use Case: Climate Data Store (CDS) API (cdsapi) is a Python library that allows users to request and download data from the Copernicus Climate Data Store. 

Code Details and Examples:

Code:

```python
import cdsapi

c = cdsapi.Client()

c.retrieve(
    'reanalysis-era5-land',
    {
        'format': 'grib',
        'variable': '2m_temperature',
        'year': '2020',
        'month': '01',
        'day': '01',
        'time': '12:00'
    },
    'download.grib')
 ```

This will retrieve the 2m_temperature of ERA5-Land reanalysis from Copernicus CDS for year 2020, month of January, day 1 at 12:00 in grib format and download the file as 'download.grib'. 

Note that input file is not required in this case as parameters are provided in the code itself.

Command line usage:
The package can be used in command line as a python script. Save the above example as a python file (example.py) and run with:
```
 python example.py
```
