Use Case: r-rcolorbrewer is an R package that allows for the creation of color palettes for thematic maps. Predefined color palettes from the 'ColorBrewer' project can be utilized, which are particularly suitable for encoding different types of data patterns (e.g. sequential, diverging).

Code Details and Examples: Code

Step 1: Load the library

```R
library(RColorBrewer)
```

Step 2: To display all color palettes available

```R
display.brewer.all()
```

Step 3: To create a color palette

```R
color_palette <- brewer.pal(4, "Dark2")
```

This command creates a color palette with four colors from the "Dark2" palette.

Step 4: To use the created color palette in a plot

```R
plot(1:4, bg = color_palette, pch = 21)
```

This creates a plot with the color palette applied. Here, `1:4` are the data points, `bg = color_palette` applies the color palette to the data points, and `pch = 21` specifies a particular type of points (here, circles filled with the specified background colors).

Note: RColorBrewer does not require any input files. The user directly uses the commands in the R environment to create and manipulate palettes.
