Use Case: Use STARFusion for detecting fusion transcripts from RNA-Seq data. 

Code details and examples:

Code:
```
STAR-Fusion --genome_lib_dir $CTAT_GENOME_LIB/GRCh37_gencode_v19_CTAT_lib_Apr032020.plug-n-play/ctat_genome_lib_build_dir/ -J Chimeric.out.junction --output_dir star_fusion_outdir
```

* `$CTAT_GENOME_LIB/GRCh37_gencode_v19_CTAT_lib_Apr032020.plug-n-play/ctat_genome_lib_build_dir/` - This represents the genome library directory. The user should replace this path with the path to their own genome library directory. 

* `Chimeric.out.junction` - Represents the Junctions file. This file must be in the Star-Fusion junction reads format. 

* `star_fusion_outdir` - Represents the output directory. The user should replace this with the path to their own desired output directory.

Please note that the parameters specified are not exhaustive and optional parameters might be needed depending on the specifics of the project.

The command to run the STAR-Fusion would generally look something like this:
```
./STAR-Fusion [options]
```

Where `[options]` represent the input and output directories, paths to the necessary reference files, parameters for the algorithm among others.
