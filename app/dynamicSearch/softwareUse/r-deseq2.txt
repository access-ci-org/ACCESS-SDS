Use Case: Differential expression analysis of RNA-Seq data.

Code details and examples:

DESeq2 is a bioinformatics tool used for differential expression analysis of count data from high-throughput sequencing assays such as RNA-Seq. This tool is implemented as a R package.

Sample Input File:

An example of an input file for DESeq2 is a CSV file containing the counts of reads mapped to each gene in each sample. 

The format required is a CSV file with the first column containing the gene identifiers and the remaining columns containing the read counts for each sample, like so:

```
"Gene","Sample1","Sample2","Sample3"
"Gene1",10,12,14
"Gene2",20,22,24
"Gene3",30,32,34
```

Code Snippet:

Here is a simple example of using DESeq2 in R:

```r
library(DESeq2)

# Load the count data
countdata <- read.csv("countdata.csv", row.names = 1)

# Specify the conditions for each sample
condition <- factor(c("control","control","treatment"))

# Create a DESeqDataSet object
dds <- DESeqDataSetFromMatrix(countData = countdata, colData = DataFrame(condition = condition), design = ~ condition)

# Perform differential expression analysis
dds <- DESeq(dds)

# Get the results
res <- results(dds)

# Plot the results
plotMA(res, main = "DESeq2")
```

In this code snippet, `DESeqDataSetFromMatrix` is used to create a DESeqDataSet object from the count data, `DESeq` is then used to perform the differential expression analysis, and `results` is used to get the results of the analysis. The results are then plotted using `plotMA`.

Command to run:

In R, source the script like so:

```r
source("deseq2_script.R")
```
Where "deseq2_script.R" is the name of your script.
