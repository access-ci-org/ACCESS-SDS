Use Case: Homopolish is a post-polishing tool used for improving the accuracy of assembly of an organism's genomic sequence. Specifically, Homopolish is used for correcting errors in viral and bacterial Nanopore genomic data.

Code details and examples: Code 

The example provided below does not include input file formats as Homopolish automatically takes care of file conversion.

1. In order to use Homopolish, you need assembly data in FASTA format.
   For the example, assume a file named `assembly.fasta` that contains assembled genomic sequences.

2. Additionally, we would need trained models which come with the installation of Homopolish.

Here is an example of how to run Homopolish:

```bash
homopolish polish -a assembly.fasta -f {model folder} -t {number of threads}
```

Parameters: 

- `-a`: Specifies the file that was used to contain the assembled sequences.
- `-f`: Directory of trained models.
- `-t`: Number of threads.

Provide the actual path for `{model folder}` (folder where trained models are stored) and  
Provide the actual integer for `{number of threads}` (Number of parallel computations that can be run, depends on the user's equipment.)
This command will generate a polished FASTA file as output.

Remember that the actual path and parameter values based on your local environment need to be substituted in the placeholder `{model folder}` and `{number of threads}`.
