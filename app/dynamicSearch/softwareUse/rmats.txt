Use Case: rMATS is an automated pipeline used for the detection of differential alternative splicing (AS) events from RNA-Seq data. The inputs to rMATS are a pair of RNA-Seq datasets and output the difference in AS between the two datasets. 

Code Details and Examples:

Input file formats: It takes BAM or SAM format alignment files as input which are produced from aligning RNA-Seq reads to the reference genome.

Input Specifications:

1. Paired-end reads aligned BAM file: `--b1 "readAlign.1.bam,readAlign.2.bam"`
2. Single-end reads aligned BAM file: `--b1 "readAlign.1.bam,readAlign.2.bam"`
3. Reference gene model in GTF format: `--gtf refGene.gtf`
4. Reference genome sequence: `--readLength 101 --genome hg19`

To prepare input:

1. Align your paired-end or single-end reads to reference genome using any aligner like STAR or Tophat and obtain BAM files.
2. Alignments must be ordered by read name rather than by position.
3. The gene model (annotation) must be downloaded in GTF format and reference genome sequence should also be available during command run.

Code Snippet for paired-end reads:

```
python2 rmats.py --b1 "readAlign.1.bam,readAlign.2.bam" --gtf refGene.gtf --readLength 101 --genome hg19 --od outputFolder
```

Here,
--b1 -> Input BAM/SAM files of Dataset.
--gtf -> Annotation file in GTF format.
--readLength -> Length of the read.
--genome -> Genome version used.
--od -> denotes the output directory.
