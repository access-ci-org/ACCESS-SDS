Use Case: Use Attrdict to simplify the code while accessing data stored in dictionaries.

Code details and examples: 

Code:
```python
from attrdict import AttrDict

employee = AttrDict({'Name': 'John', 'Age': 25, 'Role': 'Manager'})

# Traditional dictionary access
print(employee['Name']) # Output: John

# AttrDict access
print(employee.Name) # Output: John
```

No input files required. The data is input directly into the python script through a dictionary. AttrDict is a subclass of dict, so it follows the same format as a dictionary in python - a collection of key-value pairs enclosed within curly braces. Keys are unique identifiers for the values. 

Command to run:
Assuming the code is saved in a file named script.py, use the following command to run it in the terminal.

```bash
python script.py
```
