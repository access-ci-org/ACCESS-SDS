Use Case: Jellyfish is a bioinformatics software that aids in fast, memory-efficient counting of K-mers in DNA data. Ideal for genome assembly projects.

Code details and examples: Code 

For Jellyfish, an input file is required, preferably in FASTA or FASTQ format. The input files should contain DNA or RNA sequences.

For example, if you have a FASTA file containing the following sequences:

```sh
>seq1
AGTCTAGTAGTCGATGCTAGT
>seq2
TGCATAGTCGTACTACGATCT
```

1. Counting k-mers of size 22 with jellyfish:

```sh
jellyfish count -m 22 -s 100M -t 10 -C -o output.jf input.fasta
```

In this command, `-m` specifies the size of the k-mer (22 in this case), `-s` specifies the initial hash size (100M is 100 million),  `-t` specifies the number of threads, `-C` enables canonical (lexicographically smaller between a k-mer and its reverse complement) counting, `-o` specifies the output file, and finally, the input file.

2. Getting k-mer statistics:

```sh
jellyfish stats output.jf
```
3. Querying a specific k-mer:

```sh
jellyfish query output.jf AGTCTAGTAGTCGATGCTAGT
```

In the above command, `output.jf` is the output file from the count process, and `AGTCTAGTAGTCGATGCTAGT` is the k-mer being queried. This would return the count of this specific k-mer.
