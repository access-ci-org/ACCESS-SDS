Use Case: Use r-geoquery as a package in R for interaction with Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), a public genomic database from the NCBI. It is typically used to retrieve microarray, next generation sequencing and other high throughput genomics data.

Code details and examples: 

Code:

```R
# Load the package
library(GEOquery)

# Define the series id 
gseid <- "<Your_GEO_ID>"
  
# Get the series matrix file
gset <- getGEO(gseid, GSEMatrix =TRUE, getGPL=FALSE)

# Print out the eset
print(summary(exprs(gset[[1]])))
```

The input required is a valid GEO series identifier (GSE ID). You can get such IDs from the GEO database. Replace `<Your_GEO_ID>` with the obtained GSE ID.

To run this code, you will need to have R installed on your system, along with the GEOquery library. You can execute it in the R console, or in an R script. 

The output obtained will be a summary of expressions retrieved from the given GSE ID. The data retrieved is gene expression data, usually in a tabulated format with headers describing the genes and their expression values across different samples.
