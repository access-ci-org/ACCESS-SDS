Use Case: Debugging code, fixing errors, examining the state of a program while it's running.

Code Details and Examples: 

Code:

For Python, the built-in debugger is pdb. Here's an example usage:

```python
import pdb

def add_numbers(x, y):
    sum = x + y
    pdb.set_trace()  # This will pause the execution here, like a breakpoint in other debuggers
    return sum

print(add_numbers(1, 2))
```

You run this program as you would any other Python script: `python script.py`. When the execution hits the `pdb.set_trace()` line, it will drop into the debugger. 

In the pdb debugger, you can examine the state of the program with commands like:

- `p variable`: Print the value of a variable.
- `n`: Execute the next line.
- `c`: Continue execution until the next breakpoint or the program ends.

For C/C++, a common debugger is gdb. Here's an example usage:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int add_numbers(int x, int y) {
    return x + y;
}

int main() {
    int z = add_numbers(1, 2);
    printf("%d\n", z);
    return 0;
}
```

To compile this code with debugging symbols, use `gcc -g -o program program.c`.

To run the program under gdb, use `gdb program`. To set a breakpoint at a function, use `break function_name`. To run the program until a breakpoint or the program ends, use `run`. In the gdb debugger, commands are similar to pdb, but a few differences are:

- `print variable`: Print the value of a variable.
- `next`: Execute the next line.
- `continue`: Continue execution until the next breakpoint or the program ends.
