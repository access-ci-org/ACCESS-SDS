Use Case: Using C++ software language to write a basic "Hello World" program.

Code details and examples: 

Code:

```c++
// Hello World in C++

#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::cout << "Hello World!";
    return 0;
}
```

In the above code, `#include <iostream>` is a header file library that includes the declarations for basic input/output services in C++. `std::cout` is the object that sends the output to standard out device, which is typically the computer screen.

The required input file is a .cpp file that contains the C++ source code. In this case, the C++ source code is written directly in the text editor or Integrated Development Environment (IDE) used to write and compile C++.

To compile and run this code (in Linux environment), navigate to the directory containing the .cpp file in the terminal and use the g++ compiler. If the file is named `hello_world.cpp`, the commands would be:

Compile:
```sh
g++ hello_world.cpp -o hello_world
```

Run:
```sh
./hello_world
```

This will print `Hello World!` to the terminal.
