Use Case: Hyper-shell is used for queue management, resource monitoring and accounting in HPC environments. It allows the submission of jobs to a cluster, monitors their execution and gathers statistics about their resource usage.

Code details and examples:

Code Input File: job_script.sh
The script should contain the following lines:

```
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH --job-name=test
#SBATCH --output=test.out
#SBATCH --error=test.err
#SBATCH --time=01:00:00
#SBATCH --ntasks=16
#SBATCH --partition=normal

module load <your-software-module>

<your-software-command> <parameters>
```

Replace `<your-software-module>` with the module you wish to load and replace `<your-software-command> <parameters>` with the command to run your software along with any required parameters.

Command to run the script: `sbatch job_script.sh` This will submit the job to the cluster. Please note that the account name and partition name in the `sbatch` command should match your HPC system specifications. This command will generate an id. You can check state of your job with command `squeue -j <job_id>`.
