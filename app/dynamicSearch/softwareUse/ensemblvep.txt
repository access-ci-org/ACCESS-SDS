Use Case: Variant Effect Predictor (VEP) is a Perl script that uses the Ensembl API to access the Ensembl data for variant annotation. It annotates the input variants with the consequence, predictive scores, and other relevant information.

Code Details and Examples: 

Code: 
To run the basic version of VEP use the following command (Single line command)

```
./vep -i input.vcf --cache
```
Where "input.vcf" is the name of your input file.

Below is the outline of a typical VCF file (input file)

```
##fileformat=VCFv4.1
#CHROM  POS ID  REF ALT QUAL    FILTER  INFO
20  14370   rs6054257 G   A   29  PASS    NS=3;DP=14;AF=0.5;DB;H2
20  17330   .   T   A   3   q10 NS=3;DP=11;AF=0.017
20  1110696 .   A   G,T 67  PASS    NS=2;DP=10;AF=0.333,0.667;AA=T;DB
```
In this file, the columns are `#CHROM`, `POS`, `ID`, `REF`, `ALT`, `QUAL`, `FILTER`, `INFO`. These columns contain the chromosome name, start and end positions, ID, reference allele, alternative allele, quality scores, filters and other information respectively. 

The `AF` under the `INFO` column denotes Allele Frequencies, where multiple values are separated by commas which correspond to multiple alternative alleles.

Please prepare the input vcf file following this format.

Code:
To run VEP with the additional options for filtering and format conversion:

```
./vep -i input.vcf --cache --filter "Consequence is missense_variant" --vcf
```
Note:
`--filter` command is used to filter the results based on the consequences.
`--vcf` command converts the output into VCF format.
