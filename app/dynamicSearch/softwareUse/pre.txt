Use Case: Preparing and analyzing molecular dynamics simulations with GROMACS.

Code details and examples:
Code:

Input file: 
The main input file for GROMACS is a .mdp file, which includes all the necessary parameters for the molecular dynamics run. The file extension must be .mdp

Example of a .mdp file:

; Template mdp file for Molecular Dynamics Simulation 
integrator = md 
nsteps = 100000 
dt = 0.002 
nstxout = 500 
nstvout = 500 
nstenergy = 500 
nstlog = 500 
continuation = no 
constraint_algorithm = lincs 
constraints = all-bonds
cutoff-scheme = Verlet 
ns_type = grid 
nstlist = 10 
rlist = 1.0 
rcoulomb = 1.0 
vdwtype = cut-off 
rvdw = 1.0 
tcoupl = v-rescale 
tc-grps = Protein Non-Protein 
tau_t = 0.1 0.1 
ref_t = 300 300 
pcoupl = Parrinello-Rahman 
pcoupltype = isotropic 
tau_p = 1.0 
compressibility = 4.5e-5 
ref_p = 1.0 

Command to run the GROMACS:

To run the GROMACS simulation, use gmx mdrun. For example, if your input file is named "simulation.mdp", the command would be:

gmx mdrun -s simulation.tpr

Where -s specifies the name of the input file. The output will be a trajectory (.xtc) file and an energy (.edr) file.
