Use Case: DMTCP (Distributed MultiThreaded Checkpointing) is a tool that can be used to checkpoint a set of threads with minimal intervention. This is particularly useful in long-running computations where a failure could lead to significant loss of computation. 

Code details and examples: 

DMTCP works by intercepting function calls from your program to the operating system. Hence, no modifications to your source code are necessary. For example, consider a simple C program that counts indefinitely:

```
#include<stdio.h>
#include<unistd.h>

int main() {
    int count = 0;
    while(1) {
        printf("%d\n", count++);
        sleep(1);
    }
    return 0;
}
```

To checkpoint this process, you would first compile and run your program through DMTCP. Here's how you'd do that:

```
$ gcc -o counter counter.c
$ dmtcp_launch ./counter
```

This will run the process and periodically checkpoint it. While the process is running, in a different terminal window, you can do a checkpoint by running:

```
$ dmtcp_command --checkpoint
```

This will create a checkpoint image. Now, you can kill the process and later restart it from the last checkpoint:

```
$ dmtcp_restart ckpt_counter_*.dmtcp
```

DMTCP restarts the process right where it left off, even though it was previously killed. DMTCP is very robust and works with many programs, and even full-blown applications, out-of-the-box.
