Use Case: Use Singularity for running reproducible scientific analyses in a portable software container.

Code details and examples: Code

To use Singularity, you need a Singularity Image File (SIF) file. SIF files are single-file binary representations of the container and its contents. Consider that we have a Singularity image named "my_image.sif".

```bash
# Sample command to run a shell within the container
singularity shell my_image.sif
```

To run a specific command within the container, use:

```bash
singularity exec my_image.sif ls /data
```

For scripts or applications within a SIF, the Singularity run command can be used:

```bash
singularity run my_image.sif
```

For running MPI applications:

```bash
mpirun -np 20 singularity exec my_image.sif ./my_mpi_application
```

Specifications and name of required input files depend on the scientific application you have chosen to run within the Singularity container.

Regarding input file formatting, it would depend on the contained program. Singularity itself doesn't require any specific input file or format. It simply provides a contained and reproducible environment in which to run your scientific applications.

Note: For creating your own SIF files with a specific environment, Singularity takes a specification file (a text file named Singularity) as input.
