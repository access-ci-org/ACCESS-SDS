Use Case: Using r-glue for a simple concatenation of strings

Code details and examples:

Code:

```R
#input data
name <- "John Doe"
birth_year <- 1990

# using glue() function for concatenation
library(glue)
output <- glue("My name is {name} and I was born in {birth_year}.")
print(output)
```

This R code concatenates the strings from the variables "name" and "birth_year" into a complete sentence. The glue() function in the glue package is a simple and flexible way to combine strings.

Command to run it:

```R
Rscript filename.R
```
Where "filename.R" is the name of the R file that contains the above script.
