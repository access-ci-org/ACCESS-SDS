Use Case: BUSCO (Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologs) is a quality assessment tool for genomic and annotated data. It's predominantly used for measuring the completeness of the assembled genome, transcriptome, or proteome in terms of their expected gene content.

Code Details and Example: 

Code: The BUSCO assessment is performed by running the program by providing it the genome file and the lineage dataset. Here is an example command:

```bash
busco -i input.fasta -o output_dir -l lineage_dataset
```

Sample Input File: The primary input for BUSCO is genome sequence data provided in a FASTA format. 

```
>seq1
AACTAGGTACCGTTGAGATCGATCGATG
>seq2
AGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGTAGCTAGT
>seq3
ACGTACGTAGCTAGTAGCTGACTAGCATG
```

Format Required: FASTA file format.

Specifications & Details in Input Files: The input genome sequence data should be in the .fasta format having sequence identifier starting with ">" followed by sequence data in the new line.

Command to run them: 

```bash
busco -i genome.fasta -o busco_out -l bacteria_odb9
``` 

This command runs BUSCO on the genome.fasta file, creates an output folder named busco_out, and uses the bacteria lineage dataset for comparison.
