Use Case: The PMIx (Process Management Interface Exascale) is an HPC (High-Performance Computing) software library that provides an interface between the application and its potential hosts - providing services such as launching applications across multiple nodes and exchanging messages between them.

Code details and examples: Code

Sample Input File:
```c
#include <pmix.h>

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
    pmix_value_t *val;
    pmix_proc_t proc;

    PMIx_Init(&proc, NULL, 0);
    
    PMIx_Get(&proc, "PMIX_RANK", NULL, 0, &val);

    printf("My rank is %d\n", val->data.uint32);
    
    PMIx_Finalize(NULL, 0);
    
    return 0;
}
```
Format required: The code above needs to be written in a `.c` file.

Specifications and details in input files: The code above uses the PMIx library to initialize a process, get its rank, and then finalize the process. libpmix is a standalone implementation of the PMIx standard to provide client and server-side services.

Command to run:

```bash
mpicc code.c -o code -lpmix
```
After we compile code.c, we can run it with:
```bash
mpirun -np 3 ./code
```
