Use Case: Use Redis for key-value storage, message queue and caching data in-memory for faster access.

Code details and examples: Code

Package Name: Redis

- File format: No specific input file needed. Redis uses commands in the form of Redis Query Language (RQL). 

Start the Redis server with the following command:

```redis-server```

Write a Python script to set up a key-value pair in Redis:

```python
import redis

r = redis.Redis(
    host='localhost',
    port=6379)  

r.set('foo', 'bar')
```

This script connects to a Redis server running on localhost at port 6379 and sets the key 'foo' to the value 'bar'.

To retrieve this value:

```python
value = r.get('foo')
print(value)  # Prints: b'bar'
```

This script gets the value at key 'foo' from the Redis server and prints it to console.

These example commands are executed at command line via Python interpreter:

```python3 your_script.py```

Before running your Python script, make sure you have Redis server running and Python3 is installed with `redis` library.
