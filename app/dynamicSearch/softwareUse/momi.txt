Use Case: 
momi, short for "model-based inference of recent population history", allows you to both simulate genetic data under a range of demographic scenarios, and also to infer demographic parameters based on observed patterns of genetic variation. It's primary use is to study the demographic history of a population.

Code details and examples: 

Code:

First, it is necessary to read in a dataset. In this case, the data comes in the form of SFS, or site frequency spectra. This is the distribution of the frequency of derived alleles among a sample.

```
sfs = momi.Sfs.load("data.sfs.gz")
```

Then, a model needs to be defined. This is done using the `DemographicModel` objects in momi. 

```
model = momi.DemographicModel(N_e=1e4, gen_time=29, muts_per_gen=2.35e-8)
```

The parameters of the model are defined in the command above, including the effective population size (`N_e`), the generation time (`gen_time`), and the mutation rate (`muts_per_gen`).

Then, additions can be made to the model. For instance, a population bottleneck 5000 years ago can be simulated with:

```
model.set_size("pop1", t=5000, N=1e3)
```

This command sets the size of the population "pop1" to `N=1e3` at time `t=5000`.

Data can then be simulated from this model using the following command,

```
sfs = model.simulate_sfs()
```

And parameters can be inferred based on the simulated data,

```
model.infer_params(sfs)
```

The command to run the Python script which contains these codes, say "momi_script.py" should be:
```
python momi_script.py
```
