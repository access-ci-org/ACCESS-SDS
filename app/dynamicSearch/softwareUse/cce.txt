Use Case: Compiling and running a C++ code using Cray Programming Environment's Cray Compiler Environment(cce).

Code details and examples: 

Code:
The typical C++ code used for this use-case can be a basic Hello World program.

For instance: 

```cpp
#include<iostream>

int main()
{
	std::cout << "Hello, World!\n";
	return 0;
}
```

This code can be saved in a file called HelloWorld.cpp.

Input File format: 
In this instance, HelloWorld.cpp is a text file including the C++ source code.

Specifications: 
C++ source code should follow the syntax and semantics of C++. 

Command to run the code:

To compile and run the code on a system with Cray Programming Environment installed, the following commands are used.

To compile the code, use:
```shell
CC -o HelloWorld HelloWorld.cpp
```
After the above command, if there are no errors in the code, an executable file named HelloWorld is created.

To run the created executable, use:
```shell
./HelloWorld
```
