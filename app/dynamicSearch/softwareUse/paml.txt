Use Case: Phylogenetic Analysis by Maximum Likelihood (PAML) is a package of programs for phylogenetic analyses of DNA or protein sequences using maximum likelihood. It is often used for the reconstruction of evolutionary histories and studying molecular evolution. 

Code details and examples:

Code: codeml

Sample input file: This is an example of a control file required to run codeml, one of the programs in PAML. The control file is case sensitive and usually named something like "codeml.ctl".

    seqfile = seqfile.txt  * sequence data file name
    outfile = results.txt  * main result file name 
    treefile = tree.phy * tree structure file name
    noisy = 9  * lots of rubbish on the screen
    verbose = 1 * detailed output
    runmode = 0 * user defined tree
    model = 0 * one omega ratio for all branches
    NSsites = 0 * no site heterogeneity
    icode = 0 * universal code
    fix_kappa = 0 * kappa fixed 
    kappa = 2 * initial or fixed kappa
    fix_omega = 0 * omega to be estimated 
    omega = 0.5 * initial or fixed omega

The above file format is required to run the codeml program from PAML. It uses a sequential file (seqfile.txt), a tree structure (tree.phy) and specifies some parameters for the model.

To run codeml, place the control file in the same directory as the executable file and use the following command:

Command to run: `./codeml codeml.ctl`

Note: The sequence and tree file should be in the correct format and in the same directory as the `codeml` program and the control file. 

This will produce an output file named results.txt which will contain the results of the phylogenetic analysis.
