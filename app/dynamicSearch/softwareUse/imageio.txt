Use Case: Use Imageio for reading and writing image data. It supports a wide variety of image types, including animated images, volumetric data, and scientific formats. 

Code details and examples:

Code:

```
import imageio

# Reading an image
image = imageio.imread('/path/to/image.png')

# Displaying the image
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.imshow(image)
plt.show()

# Writing an image
output_image = function_that_manipulates_image(image)  # This could be any function that returns a numpy array
imageio.imsave('/path/to/output.png', output_image)
```

Input files: The input for imageio.imread and imageio.imsave are strings that specify the path to the image file. The path can be either relative or absolute. The mentioned image files can be in various formats like jpg, png, tif etc.

Command to run:

In a python environment where imageio is installed, this script can just be run as a regular python script:

`python script.py`
