Use Case: Pythia is primarily used for event generation in high-energy physics. It is a library for generating events in high-energy collisions.

Code details and examples:

Code:
```
import pythia8

# Create Pythia instance
pythia = pythia8.Pythia()

# Set up the beams, for frame with unequal beam energies.
pythia.settings.mode("Beams:frameType", 2)

# Set up the lifetime of unstable particles.
pythia.particleData.mayDecay(300, False)
```

Input Files: Pythia does not rely on specific input files, instead, it sets parameters and commands via a Python interface.

Commands to run this sample:

1. Write the above code to a file, say `test_pythia.py`.
2. Run the file using Python:

```
python test_pythia.py
```

Specification in Input Files: Since Pythia's settings and parameters are directly set in the code, there is no need for specific formatting of input files. However, information related to events and particles can be adopted in a format that Pythia can understand. More details can be obtained from the Pythia user manual.
