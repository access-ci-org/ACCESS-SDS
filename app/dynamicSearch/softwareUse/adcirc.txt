Use Case: The ADvanced CIRCulation (ADCIRC) is extensively used for predicting storm surge and tidal circulation. It helps researchers to predict the water levels and currents caused by meteorological events like hurricanes or generic storms for oceanographic studies.

Code details and examples:

Code:

ADCIRC uses an unstructured grid of triangular elements allowing the spatial resolution to be maximized in areas of complex geometry while being minimized in areas of lesser importance. The input file has the .14 extension for ADCIRC, which contains the information of each element's coordinates along with their connectivity.

Sample of a .14 file:
```
! Following are the overview number of nodes and elements
171959 259634
! "Node" "x coordinate" "y coordinate" "Depth"
1 -58667.388000 335647.526000 -0.453800
...
171959 -74586.797000 334707.259000 -1.221100
! "Node ID" "Connection 1" "Connection 2" "Connection 3"
1 166515 166520 166519
...
259634 45491 45846 45847

ADCIRC comes with different sets of parameters used for fintuning and describing physical processes involved in a simulation, these parameters are located in a fort.15 file which contains information to perform the simulation and often change based on simulation type and intent.

Sample of a fort.15 file:
```
! Following is the name of the model run
Model Run Test_1
!Following are the overview parameters of the model
20., -1.000000, 10.000000, 01/01/2021, 20:00:00, 432000, 0.005000, 0.005000, 0.005000, 0.005000,
!Following are various flags and values to tune the model
0, 0, 1.000000, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0,
0, 10,  270.000000, 1, 0, -1, 26, T, T, T, T, T, F, T, F, F, F, 0.,
! Units and format related parameters
F, F, F, F, 1, F, F, F
```
To run ADCIRC, navigate to the directory containing the prepared input files:

```command
./padcirc -ksp_type bcgs
