Use Case: Use CDAT to read, slice, and manipulate your data formats such as netCDF, HDF, GRIB, etc. 

Code Details and Examples: Code

CDAT doesn't have specific input files. However, it is used mainly to manipulate and visualize scientific data, most commonly stored in netCDF format (self-describing, machine-independent data formats that support the creation, access, and sharing of array-oriented scientific data). 

For example, let's say you have a NetCDF data file (e.g., 'sample.nc') and you want to open it and view a summary:

```python
import cdms2

# Open the dataset
f = cdms2.open('sample.nc')

# Get the variable in dataset
slp = f('slp')

# Check the shape of variable
print(slp.shape)

# Print the data summary
print(slp)

f.close()
```

To run the python file (assuming 'cdat_script.py' contains the code):
```sh
$ python cdat_script.py
```

You should preciously set your datasets to variables and call methods on them to manipulate them as per need. If the dataset has time as a dimension, there are methods provided by the CDAT library to slice and dice data across time, levels, latitude, longitude etc.
