Use Case: BLASR (Basic Local Alignment with Successive Refinement) is a tool used to align sequences, especially long PacBio reads, to a reference genome. 

Code details and examples: Code 

The PacBio.Blasr has requirements for the input file such as sequencing data in FASTA/FASTQ/BAM formats and reference genome in FASTA format.

Here is a simple command for running Blasr:

```bash
blasr reads.fasta reference.fasta -bestn 10 -minPctIdentity 70.0 -m 1 -out aligned.m1
```
In this example:

- "reads.fasta" is your sequencing data input file.
- "reference.fasta" is your reference genome input file.
- "-bestn 10" tells BLASR to report the best 10 alignments.
- "-minPctIdentity 70.0" sets the minimum percent identity for reporting an alignment.
- "-m 1" specifies the output format (0=BLASR default, 1=tab-delimited).
- "-out aligned.m1" is your output file.
