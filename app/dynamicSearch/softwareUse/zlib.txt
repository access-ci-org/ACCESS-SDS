Use Case: zlib is an essential library required for most compression/decompression utilities. Mainly, it is used for gzip file decompression.

Code Details and Examples: 

Code
Input files: should be in byte form or string which would be converted to bytes.

Format required: an executable command using a UTF-8 compatible terminal incorporating the zlib library 
- If compressing: String - byte sequence
- If decompressing: bytes - String

Specifications: 
- When compressing, the input file must be a string of bytes you want to compress.
- While decompressing, the input file must be of type bytes already compressed.

Code examples:

Example 1: Compressing data in Python using zlib

```python
import zlib
source_data = b"This is some data that requires compression"
compressed_data = zlib.compress(source_data)
```
Example 2: Decompressing data using zlib

```python
import zlib
compressed_data = b'x\x9c+\xc9\xc8,V\x00\xa2D\xf6\x01I\x06^\x00\xa4\xefz\x0e'
decompressed_data = zlib.decompress(compressed_data)
```

Command to run: python filename.py (Replace filename.py with your python file name)
