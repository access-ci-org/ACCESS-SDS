Use Case: Caffe is a deep learning framework that allows users to build, train and deploy neural networks. It is particularly effective for image classification and convolutional networks. 

Code details and examples: 

Code:

1. Define the network in a plain text protocol buffer (`prototxt`) format. A simple example of a LeNet for MNIST digits recognition.

```
name: "LeNet"
layer {
  name: "mnist"
  type: "Data"
  top: "data"
  top: "label"
  include {
    phase: TRAIN
  }
  transform_param {
    scale: 0.00390625
  }
  data_param {
    source: "examples/mnist/mnist_train_lmdb"
    batch_size: 64
    backend: LMDB
  }
}

... (several layers here, please refer to actual LeNet tutorial for full script)

layer {
  name: "loss"
  type: "SoftmaxWithLoss"
  bottom: "ip2"
  bottom: "label"
  top: "loss"
}
```

This defines a neural net for training on MNIST dataset. The `source` in `data_param` should be the directory of your LMDB or LevelDB (other DB backends may be used as well) file.

2. Prepare your data in the format specified inside the `prototxt` file.

3. Train your model with the following command:

```shell
./build/tools/caffe train --solver=examples/mnist/lenet_solver.prototxt
```
The solver file is another `prototxt` file that specifies options like learning rate, momentum etc.
