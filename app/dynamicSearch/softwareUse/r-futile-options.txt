Use Case: It is often useful to indicate preferences and configurations using options. This allows the options to be used in a more flexible manner than constant variables. The r-futile-options package provides a scoped options management for R that can be used to manage package options and configurations. 

Code Details and Examples:

Code:

```R
library(futile.options)

# Define a new option
options(max.iterations=100)

# Use the option
for (i in 1:options('max.iterations')) {
  print(i)
}

# Modify the value of an option
options(max.iterations=200)

# Use the option 
for (i in 1:options('max.iterations')) {
  print(i)
}
```

Command to run: This is R script, you should be able to run it in an R environment. You'll simply need to make a call to your script from the shell.
