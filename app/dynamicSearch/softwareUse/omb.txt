Use Case: The Ohio MicroBoard (OMB) software is used to simulate the behaviour of digital microcircuit boards for testing and validation. It's a utility popular among electronics engineers for product development and prototypes. It is often used to simulate FPGA designs, testbench creation, timing analysis and so forth.

Code details and examples: 

Code:
```
// Sample VHDL code for a basic flip-flop circuit 

library IEEE;
use IEEE.STD_LOGIC_1164.ALL;
use IEEE.STD_LOGIC_ARITH.ALL;
use IEEE.STD_LOGIC_UNSIGNED.ALL;

entity flip_flop is
  port(
    clk: in std_logic;
    d: in std_logic;
    q: out std_logic;
    not_q: out std_logic
  );
end flip_flop;

architecture behavior of flip_flop is
begin
  flip_flop: process(clk)
  begin
    if rising_edge(clk) then
      q <= d;
      not_q <= not d;
    end if;
  end process flip_flop;
end behavior;
```
Input file: The input for the OMB software is VHDL code (.vhdl or .vhd files). In the above example, a D flip-flop is being simulated. The change in outputs q and not_q are controlled by the state of the input d and the CLK (clock) signal.

To run this with OMB:
1. Save the VHDL file (assuming flip_flop.vhdl)
2. Open OMB and browse to the VHDL file
3. Click 'Run' to simulate
(Note: The exact commands may vary based on the OMB version and interface)
