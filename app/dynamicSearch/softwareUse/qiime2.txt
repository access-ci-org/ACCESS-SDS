Use Case: Applying the DADA2 method using qiime2 to denoise paired-end sequences from a microbiome experiment;

**Code details and examples:**

Input File Format:

The input files are typically raw sequences in fastq format. An example of the sequence might be as follows:

@M06335:119:000000000-B9H7K:1:1101:15698:1338 1:N:0:1
NNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN
+
# , 5< < : 1 1 AGGGFFEFFGGGGGGGCFFFFF/ACFFEFFDGAFGGG

File Specifications:

- Each sequence read starts with '@'.
- Immediately after '@', there are unique identifiers for the sequence.
- The second line represents actual sequence data.
- '+' is an indicator of quality scores of the sequence.
- The fourth line contains corresponding quality scores for the sequence data where each character represents a quality score.

Code Snippet:

   ```
   qiime dada2 denoise-paired \
     --i-demultiplexed-seqs paired-end-demux.qza \
     --p-trim-left-f 13 \
     --p-trim-left-r 13 \
     --p-trunc-len-f 150 \
     --p-trunc-len-r 150 \
     --o-representative-sequences rep-seqs-dada2.qza \
     --o-table table-dada2.qza \
     --o-denoising-stats stats-dada2.qza
   ```

Command Details:

- qimme dada2 denoise-paired: Command to run the DADA2 pipeline on paired-end sequences.
- --i-demultiplexed-seqs: The input file containing the sequences in QIIME2's QZA format.
- --p-trim-left-f and --p-trim-left-r: The number of bases that should be removed from the start of forward and reverse reads.
- --p-trunc-len-f and --p-trunc-len-r: The position at which forward and reverse reads should be truncated due to decrease in quality.
- --o-representative-sequences, --o-table, --o-denoising-stats: The output files in QZA format to store the representative sequences, the feature table and the denoising stats respectively.

This command will apply the DADA2 method on paired-end sequences, and output representative sequences, a feature table, and statistics of the denoising process. The preceding two parameters determine how much the sequences should be trimmed from the start, and where to truncate the sequences.
