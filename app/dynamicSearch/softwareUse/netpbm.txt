Use Case: Netpbm is a toolkit for manipulation of graphic images, including conversion of images between a variety of different formats. This toolkit can be used to convert an image from one format (e.g., JPEG) to another format (e.g., PNG).

Code details and examples:

Code:

Input file: A JPEG image.

Specifications and details in input file: The JPEG image can be any image that needs to be converted. It should be in .jpg format.

To convert a JPEG image to a PNG image using the Netpbm toolkit's `jpegtopnm` and `pnmtopng` utilities, you would use the following command:

```bash
jpegtopnm input.jpg | pnmtopng > output.png
```

This will read the JPEG image from 'input.jpg', convert it to PNM format, then pipe that PNM image to `pnmtopng`, which converts it to PNG format and writes it to 'output.png'.
