Use Case: libXdmcp is a library that allows for the manipulation of X Display Manager Control Protocol (XDMCP) messages, which is used to start remote X sessions.

Code details and examples: The library doesn't offer a direct interface for user interaction, therefore any code showing usage has to be a part of a more complex X windows program. Below is an example from the X server source code, representing how the library is used -

Code:

```c
#include <X11/Xdmcp.h>

void example() {
    XdmcpBuffer buffer;
    CARD16 displayNumber;

    /* Initialize the buffer. This would be where a message is received from. */
    XdmcpInitBuffer(&buffer, some_data, some_data_length);

    /* Read out a CARD16 (16-bit value) from the buffer. This could be the display number from the packet */
    XdmcpReadCARD16(&buffer, &displayNumber);
}
```

The above example initializes an XDMCP buffer and reads a 'CARD16' type value from it. This is roughly analogous to reading a 16-bit integer from a packet of network data. The real packets would contain much more information.

The command to build a file `x.c` using libXdmcp:

```
gcc -o x x.c -lXdmcp
```

The -lXdmcp option tells gcc to link against libXdmcp. The resulting executable file can be run by typing `./x`.

Remember this is a very minimal example and usage of libXdmcp in actual programs will be more advanced and complex, like in Xorg, the open source implementation of the X Window System.
