Use Case: Simulates the total energy, charge density and electronic structure of molecules and solids with Density Functional Theory (DFT). 

Code details and examples:

Code: ABINIT

Sample Input Files: 

The input file required is usually a text file with a '.in' extension. This file contains keywords for input variable under 3 sections - Dataset, File and Groundstate.

Example of an input file: 
```
 ndtset 3 
 acell 10 10 10 
 rprim 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 
 natom 2 
 ntypat 2 
 typat 1 2 
 xred 
  0 0 0 
  0.75 0.75 0.75 
```

This file directs ABINIT to perform 3 calculations (ndtset 3), on a system with a 10 angstrom cubic simulation cell (acell 10 10 10 and rprim 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1) containing two atoms of different types (natom 2 and ntypat 2 and typat 1 2) situated at specific positions specified under xred.

Command to run it:

`abinit < file.in > file.out`

This command runs ABINIT using 'file.in' as the input file and 'file.out' as the output file.
