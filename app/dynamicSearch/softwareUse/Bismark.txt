Use Case: Bismark is a program to map bisulfite treated sequencing reads and perform methylation calls in a single step. The output can be easily imported into a genome viewer, such as SeqMonk, and enables a researcher to analyze and compare his methylation data with a reference genome.

Code details and examples:

Bismark requires input in FastQ format. The FastQ file should contain the bisulfite converted sequences. Bismark is able to process single-end or paired-end reads, which can be uncompressed or gzip compressed.

Sample inputs:

Here is an example of a FastQ file:

    @SEQ_ID
    GATTTGGGGTTCAAAGCAGTATCGATCAAATAGTAAATCCATTTGTTCAACTCACAGTTT
    +
    !''*((((***+))%%%++)(%%%%).1***-+*''))**55CCF>>>>>>CCCCCCC65

This file has four lines: 

- A sequence identifier with an optional description (starts with a '@' character).
- The raw sequence letters.
- A line that starts with a '+' character and is optionally followed by the same sequence identifier (and any description) again.
- Quality scores for the sequence in line #2, encoded as ASCII characters.

Example command to run Bismark:

The basic command to run Bismark is:

    bismark [options] <genome_folder> {-1 <mates1> -2 <mates2> | <singles>}

Here the `<genome_folder>` is the location of the reference genome, `<mates1>` and `<mates2>` are the paired-end reads (FastQ files) and `<singles>` are the single-end reads (FastQ file).

We can use this command to align the reads of `reads.fastq` against the genome in the `genome/` directory:

    bismark genome/ reads.fastq
