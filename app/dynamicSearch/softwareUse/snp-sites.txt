Use Case: Snp-sites is a software that can quickly extract SNP sites from multi-FASTA alignments. In population genomics, it's often useful to examine and study the individual sites that are variable. 

Code details and examples: 

Code:

Input file: 
snp-sites uses multi-FASTA (.msa) alignments as input files. An MSA file contains multiple sequences which are all aligned so that each column corresponds to homologous sites. 

Here is a sample excerpt of what an .msa file looks like:
```
>seq1
ATGGCA
>seq2
AT-GCA
>seq3
ATAGCA
```
In this case, there is one SNP site at the 3rd position. 

Running the command (assuming input file name is my_alignment.msa): 
`snp-sites -v my_alignment.msa`

This command will quickly extract the SNP sites from the alignment and print them to stdout. The -v flag is for printing to VCF format, which can be further piped or redirected as needed.
