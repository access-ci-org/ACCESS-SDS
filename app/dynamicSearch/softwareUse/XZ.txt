Use Case: xz is used for file compression. It reduces the size of files enabling efficient storage and faster transmission rates.

Code Details and Examples: 

In this example, we compress the file "sample.txt" using the xz command:

Command: `xz sample.txt`

This will compress the file and replace it with "sample.txt.xz".

Uncompress the file is just as easy using the -d option:

Command: `xz -d sample.txt.xz`

This will decompress the file and replace it with "sample.txt".

You can use the -k option if you want to keep the original file:

Command: `xz -k sample.txt`

This will produce a compressed file "sample.txt.xz" and also keep the original "sample.txt". Similarly you can decompress while keeping the compressed version:

Command: `xz -dk sample.txt.xz`

This will produce the decompressed file "sample.txt" and also keep the compressed version "sample.txt.xz". 

In terms of input files, xz can handle any file type, including binary and text. The contents of the file do not affect the compression process. 

The only specification is the file name, which should be a valid filename for your operating system. It does not need to have any specific extensions, however it is customary to use .xz for compressed files.
