Use Case: Use r-methylumi for differential methylation analysis of Illumina 450k arrays data in R.

Code details and examples: 

Code:

First, we load the necessary library:
```R
library(methylumi)
```
Then, we load the data:
```R
data = new("MethyLumiM", data = matrix(rnorm(10000), 100, 100), phenoData = data.frame(matrix(ncol = 2, nrow = 100)))
```
We then proceed to pfilter (probe filtering) for removing probes that have detection p-values > 0.01 in one or more samples. This removes unreliable probes from consideration:
```R
filtered_data = pfilter(data, detectionP = 0.01, num.samples = 1)
```
Finally, we normalize the filtered data using subset-quantile within array normalization (SWAN):
```R
normalized_data = SWAN(filtered_data)
```
Note: `data` is an object of class MethyLumiM where it contains methylated and unmethylated signal intensities. The `phenoData` contains sample covariates. The sample data and formats may vary based on the actual use case. 

Methylumi is used in the interactive environment of R where commands are executed one by one, so specific run command is not available.
