Use Case: RapidJSON is a JSON parser and generator for C++. It is used to process JSON data: reading it from an input and/or writing it to an output. In particular, it is commonly used for tasks like reading configuration files into memory, or writing logs of activity to disk in a format that can be easily processed later.

Code details and examples:

Code:

```C++
#include "rapidjson/document.h"
#include "rapidjson/prettywriter.h" // for stringify JSON

using namespace rapidjson;

// Parse JSON string into DOM
const char* json = "{\"project\":\"rapidjson\",\"stars\":10}";
Document d;
d.Parse(json);

// Conversely, "stringify" a DOM into JSON
StringBuffer buffer;
PrettyWriter<StringBuffer> writer(buffer);
d.Accept(writer);

// Output {"project":"rapidjson","stars":10}
std::cout << buffer.GetString() << std::endl;
```
The code snippet above demonstrates how to use RapidJSON to parse a JSON string into a Document object, and then how to "stringify" (serialize) this object back into a JSON string. 

To run the example: 

1. Save the code above into a file, e.g., main.cpp.
2. Compile the file using a C++ compiler, such as g++. For example: `g++ main.cpp -o rapidjson_example`
3. Run the compiled executable: `./rapidjson_example`

This should output: `{"project":"rapidjson","stars":10}`

RapidJSON does not require any specific input file format. As long as the input is a valid JSON string, RapidJSON can parse it.

For the code above, the JSON string 
```{"project":"rapidjson","stars":10}```
is hard-coded into the program. This string could have instead been read from an input file or network connection.
