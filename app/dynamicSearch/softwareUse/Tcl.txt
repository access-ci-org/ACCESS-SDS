Use Case: Tcl (Tool Command Language) is a dynamic programming language that is suitable for a variety of uses, from web and desktop applications development to being embedded in devices such as routers. It is also popular in the scientific community for data analysis and simulation. 

Code details and examples:

Code:

```
#Sample Tcl script that calculates the factorial of a number
proc factorial {number} {
    set result 1
    for {set i 2} {$i <= $number} {incr i} {
        set result [expr {$result*$i}]
    }
    return $result
}

# Use the procedure
set num 5
puts "The factorial of $num is [factorial $num]"
```

The input file specification in this example is a plain text file with Tcl code. The Tcl interpreter is used to read and execute this file. In this example, `factorial` is a procedure defined in Tcl that calculates the factorial of a number. We can call this procedure with a number as an argument to get the factorial of that number.

The command to run this script (named example.tcl) in a Unix-like system is:

```bash
tclsh example.tcl
```
