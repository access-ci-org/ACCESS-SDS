Use Case: Valgrind is an instrumentation framework for building dynamic analysis tools. It provides several features including detecting memory-management errors, threading bugs and profile your code for performance bottlenecks.

Code details and examples: 

Code:
Here is a simple C example where memory leak is likely to happen:

```c
#include <stdlib.h>

void f() {
    int* x = malloc(10 * sizeof(int));
    x[10] = 0;  // problem 1: heap block overrun
}  // problem 2: memory leak -- x not deallocated

int main() {
    f();
    return 0;
}
```

Save the above as "example.c". Compile it (using gcc):
```
$ gcc -o example example.c
```

Use valgrind to detect the memory error:
```
$ valgrind --tool=memcheck --leak-check=yes ./example
```
In the output, Valgrind will point out our two problems: we've overrun the end of the block we malloc'ed, and we leaked memory by failing to free that block before f() exited.
