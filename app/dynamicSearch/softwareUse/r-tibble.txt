Use Case: The `tibble` package in R is used to create tibbles, a modern reimagining of data frames, providing a cleaner, more modern take on data analysis.

Code details and examples: 

Code:

Loading the package:
```
library(tibble)
```

Creating a tibble directly:
```
# create a tibble
df <- tibble(
  x = 1:5, 
  y = 1, 
  z = x ^ 2 + y
)

print(df)
```

The above code will output the following:
```
# A tibble: 5 x 3
      x     y     z
  <int> <dbl> <dbl>
1     1     1     2
2     2     1     5
3     3     1    10
4     4     1    17
5     5     1    26
```

To run the code, one could simply copy and paste it into their R console or RStudio. Alternatively, placing the code in a .R file and running with the command `Rscript file.R` from the command line would also execute the script.
