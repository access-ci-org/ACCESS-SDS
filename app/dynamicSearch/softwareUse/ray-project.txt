Use Case: Ray is an open-source project for parallel and distributed Python that unifies mainstream distributed computing patterns into a single, flexible programming model. The use case of ray-project is to define computational workflows in Python using Tasks and Actors. 

Code Details and Examples:

Code:

```python
import ray
ray.init()

@ray.remote
def f(x):
    return x * x

futures = [f.remote(i) for i in range(10)]
print(ray.get(futures))
```

In this sample, ray.get is used to fetch the results of a remote function. The output should be: `[0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81]`

Command to run the code: 

If you're running on a Jupyter notebook, you directly run. If running from a python file, you save the code in a python file and run `python filename.py`. The filename.py is the python file where you saved the code. 

Input files, format and specifications:

No input files or specific format required. Ray takes input as function arguments which you provide while calling the function. In the above case, numbers 0 to 9 are input to function `f`.
