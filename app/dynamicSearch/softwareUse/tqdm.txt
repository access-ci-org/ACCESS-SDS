Use Case: tqdm is a Python library that allows you to output a smart progress bar by wrapping around any iterable. A simple use case is when you want to track the progress of a loop.

Code details and examples: Code

Sample code to demonstrate a simple progress bar:

```python
from tqdm import tqdm
import time

for i in tqdm(range(100)):
    time.sleep(0.01)
```

In this example, tqdm wraps around the range(100) iterable. Every time the loop progresses, tqdm updates the progress bar.

The progress bar by default contains information about:

- The number of iterations completed
- The elapsed time 
- The estimated remaining time
- The estimated iterations per second

In the terminal, it looks something like this:

```
78%|████████████████████████████      | 78/100 [00:01<00:00, 77.67it/s]
```
Run the file by the command:

```python
python filename.py
```

It's important that the range inside tqdm's parentheses to represent the total iterations for the progress bar. The time.sleep function is there to simulate a task that takes time to complete. You can include your own tasks in place of time.sleep.
