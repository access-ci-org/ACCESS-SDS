Use Case: Flye is a de novo assembler for single-molecule high-noise sequencing data, such as those produced by Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) and Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT). It's commonly used in genome sequencing and analysis, especially in the field of bioinformatics.

Code details and examples: 

Code:
Flye requires a FASTA or FASTQ file as input. The input file needs to be in a specific format, either FASTA (.fasta) or FASTQ (.fastq).

A sample minimal input FASTA file:

```
>Sequence_1
AGCTTTTCATTCTGACTGCAACGGGCAATATGTCTCTGTGTGGATTAAAAAAAGAGTGTCTGATAGCAGC
```

This file contains one sequence (Sequence_1) and its corresponding DNA bases.

A sample minimal input FASTQ file:

```
@Sequence_1
AGCTTTTCATTCTGACTGCAACGGGCAATATGTCTCTGTGTGGATTAAAAAAAGAGTGTCTGATAGCAGC
+
!''*((((***+))%%%++)(%%%%).1***-+*''))**55CCF>>>>>>CCCCCCC65
```

This file contains one sequence (Sequence_1), its corresponding DNA bases, and the quality score of individual base calls.

A basic command to run Flye could look like this:

```
flye --nano-raw reads.fastq --out-dir assembly --genome-size 5m --threads 4
```

Where:
- --nano-raw reads.fastq specifies the input file.
- --out-dir assembly specifies the output directory.
- --genome-size 5m specifies the estimated genome size (here 5 million bases).
- --threads 4 specifies the number of threads to use.
