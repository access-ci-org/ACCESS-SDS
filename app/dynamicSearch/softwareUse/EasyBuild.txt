Use Case: EasyBuild is a software build and installation framework that allows you to manage (scientific) software on High Performance Computing (HPC) systems in an efficient way.

Code Details and Examples: 

EasyBuild does not directly use input files but instead uses EasyConfig files, which provide specifications for building software, and EasyBlock Python scripts, which implement software building procedures. A typical EasyConfig file could be for installing GCC 4.8.2:

```
name = 'GCC'
version = '4.8.2'

homepage = 'http://gcc.gnu.org'
description = """The GNU Compiler Collection includes front ends for C,
C++, Objective-C, Fortran, Java, and Ada, as well as libraries for these
languages (libstdc++, libgcj,...)."""

toolchain = SYSTEM

sources = [
  'gcc-%(version)s.tar.bz2',
  'gmp-5.0.5.tar.bz2',
  'mpfr-3.1.2.tar.gz',
  'mpc-1.0.1.tar.gz',
]
source_urls = [GNU_SOURCE]

builddependencies = [('binutils', '2.23.52')]

moduleclass = 'compilers'
```

Once the EasyConfig file is created, it can be passed to the `eb` command-line tool to perform the build, like:

Command:
``` bash
eb GCC-4.8.2.eb --robot
```   

This command instructs EasyBuild to automatically install GCC version 4.8.2, including any prerequisites such as gmp, mpfr, and mpc. The `--robot` option tells EasyBuild to automatically handle dependencies.
