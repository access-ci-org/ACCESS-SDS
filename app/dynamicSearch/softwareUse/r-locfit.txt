Use Case: Use R-Locfit package to perform local regression, odds ratio or hazard ratio.

Code details and examples: Code.

1. Load the Locfit library in an R script file
```R
library(locfit)
```

2. Load the data. This can be done by using built-in datasets.

```R
data(cars)
```
If data is loaded from a CSV file, format required in CSV file:

- Each row represents a different data point or measurement.
- Each column represents a different variable. In this example, we have 2 variables: speed and dist.

```R
df <- read.csv("yourfile.csv")
```

3. Perform locfit

```R
fit <- locfit(dist~speed, data=cars)
```
Here, 'dist' is dependent variable and 'speed' is independent variable. 

4. Plot the fitted line or curve with help of 'plot' function

```R
plot(fit)
```

5. Evaluate the locfit model on required points with 'predict' function

```R
prediction = predict(fit, newdata = data.frame(speed=c(15)))
print(prediction)
```
This will predict the 'dist' for 'speed' value of 15.

The command to run the R script file (here 'script.r') from command line:
```
Rscript script.r
```
