Use Case: The r-pillar package is used in R programming for styling and formatting outputs. It provides tools for accurately formatting numbers, dates, times, and text, and for aligning them in a column. It allows users to create complex, formatted and coloured console outputs with consistent width.

Code details and examples:
Code:

```r
# Load library
library(pillar)

# Create a simple dataframe
df <- data.frame(Name = c("John", "Mike", "Sara"),
                 Age = c(23, 35, 30),
                 Salary = c(2000, 3500, 3000))

# Print dataframe with pillar
pillar::pillar(df)
```

Above code will print:

```
# A tibble: 3 x 3
  Name   Age Salary
  <chr> <dbl>  <dbl>
1 John     23   2000
2 Mike     35   3500
3 Sara     30   3000
```
Command to run:

This code can be executed in any R environment by simply pasting and running the script.
