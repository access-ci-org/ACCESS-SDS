Use Case: LAME is a high quality MPEG Audio Layer III (MP3) encoder licensed under the LGPL. LAME is a command line tool used for compressing audio files to the MP3 format.

Code details and examples: Code:

Input File: A WAV or AIFC audio file. 
Format: WAV or AIFC. 
Specifications: File must be valid and not corrupted.

```
lame input.wav output.mp3
```

This will convert the input.wav file to output.mp3 using default settings.

Sample command to set the bitrate to 320 kbps (highest quality):

```
lame -b 320 input.wav output.mp3
```

This command tells LAME to produce an MP3 with a bitrate of 320 kbps. The -b option is used for setting the bitrate.

Code snippet:

```
#include "lame/lame.h"
...
lame_global_flags *gfp;
...
gfp = lame_init();
lame_set_num_channels(gfp,2);
lame_set_in_samplerate(gfp,44100);
lame_set_brate(gfp,320);
lame_init_params(gfp);
```

The above C++ code initializes the LAME encoder, sets the number of channels to 2 (stereo), the input sample rate to 44100 Hz, and the output bitrate to 320 kbps.
