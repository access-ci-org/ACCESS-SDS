Use Case: Dsuite is used to analyze SNP data from multiple samples, for instance, to detect signs of natural selection.

Code details and examples:

Code:

Assuming we have three input files; a VCF file, a PED file and a SAMPLE file. 

The VCF file contains the genotype information. Lastly, the SAMPLE file contains information on which samples in the VCF file should be analyzed together.

VCF file (input.vcf):

```
#CHROM POS ID REF ALT QUAL FILTER INFO FORMAT Sample1 Sample2 Sample3
chr1 100 rs1 A T . PASS . GT 0/0 0/1 1/1
chr1 200 rs2 G C . PASS . GT 1/0 0/0 1/1
```

Pedigree file (input.ped):

```
Sample1 Father1 Mother1
Sample2 Father2 Mother2
Sample3 Father3 Mother3
```

SAMPLE file (input.sample):

```
Sample1
Sample2
```

Sample command for Dsuite:

```
Dsuite Dtrios input.vcf input.ped input.sample
```

This command will perform the analysis with all trios in the pedigree file that are included in the SAMPLE file. The output is a set of D-statistics for each trio, indicating whether there are significant deviations from the expected allele frequencies under the null hypothesis of no gene flow.
