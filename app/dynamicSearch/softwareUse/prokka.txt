Use Case: Prokka is used to rapidly annotate bacterial, archaeal and viral genomes producing standard output files.

Code details and examples:

1. Code snippet:

```
prokka --outdir mydir --prefix mygenome –-kb 250 myfile.fasta
```
 
2. Commands:
 
The above command will run Prokka using the genome contained in myfile.fasta, generate an output directory named mydir, output files will have prefix `mygenome`, and specify –kb as 250.

3. Input file:
 
`myfile.fasta`: This is the input file for annotation. The FASTA format is a text-based format for representing either nucleotide sequences or peptide sequences, in which nucleotides or amino acids are represented using single-letter codes. It should contain the perfect and complete sequence of the genome to be annotated.

4. Input file formats: 

Prokka can accept FASTA (.fasta, .fna, .ffn, .faa, .frn), Genbank (.gbk) and EMBL (.embl) files.

5. Output:

Prokka will create an output directory specified by the user (e.g., `mydir`), containing several files. The most important one is .gbk (GenBank file) which contains the annotated genome that can be visualized by genome browsers.

Note: Here, `mydir`, `mygenome`, `myfile.fasta` are user specific and should be replaced with user specific names and path if any.
