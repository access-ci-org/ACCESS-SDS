Use Case: Use rtracklayer to import and export data to and from the UCSC Genome Browser and other browsers that support the same protocols.

Code details and examples:
 
Code:
```R
# Import the bioconductor package
library(rtracklayer)

# To reads in a BED file, run:
bedFile <- system.file("extdata", "somefile.bed", package = "rtracklayer")
bed <- import.bed(bedFile)
print(bed)

# To export a GRanges object to a BED file, run:
export.bed(bed, file = "output.bed")

# To retrieve a track from the UCSC genome browser, run:
session <- browserSession()
genome(session) <- "hg38"
track <- getTrack(session, "RefSeq Genes")
```

Input Files:
- somefile.bed: A BED file contains genomic coordinate and gene annotation information. It has a simple format, where each line corresponds to a gene or feature and each field in the line provides information about the feature. The three mandatory fields are: chromosome name, start position and end position.

Output Files:
- output.bed: This file will store the exported GRanges object in BED format.
