Use Case: Use gzip for file compression. This can be especially useful for managing large data files.

Code details and examples: Code 

```
# Here is a simple example where we wish to compress a large text file named "example.txt"
gzip example.txt
```
Command Explanation:
The 'gzip' command followed by a filename will compress the file and replace it with a new file that has the ".gz" extension. In this example, "example.txt" will be compressed and replaced with "example.txt.gz".

Input File:
The input file "example.txt" can contain any readable text data. In our example we've used a simple text file.

Specifications: 
1. The input file can have any content and there is no specific format required.
2. The compressed file format is .gz. 

Command to Run:
To run the command, simply open your terminal (For Linux, macOS) or command prompt (For Windows) and type the command: 
```
gzip example.txt
``` 

This command will compress the file and save space in your hard drive.
