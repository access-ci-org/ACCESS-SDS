Use Case: SNP filtering and manipulation in genomic datasets.

Code details and examples: Code

1. SnpSift annotations: One common use case for SnpSift is annotating genomic variant files with additional information. 

- File Format: Input vcf file Variant Calling Format or VCF
- Specifications: One line per variant, with annotations added by SnpSift.
- Sample Input File: MyFile.vcf

Command to run: `java -jar SnpSift.jar annotate MyAnnotations.vcf MyFile.vcf > MyFile_annotated.vcf`

2. SnpSift filter: Another use case is to filter variants based on specific conditions.

- File Format: Input vcf file Variant Calling Format or VCF
- Specifications: One line per variant, filtering those that meet specified conditions.
- Sample Input File: MyFile.vcf

Code Snippet: 

First, you may need to create a filter condition. A sample condition could be 'DP > 10', filtering variants with a depth greater than 10.

Command to run: `java -jar SnpSift.jar filter "( DP > 10 )" MyFile.vcf > MyFile_filtered.vcf` 

Where `( DP > 10 )` is the condition to filter.
