Use Case: Libevent is an asynchronous event notification library that is used to build and scale high performance event-driven network servers in C or C++. This library provides a mechanism to execute a callback function when a specific event occurs on a file descriptor or after a timeout has been reached. 

Code details and examples:

Code:
```C
#include <event2/event.h>
#include <event2/bufferevent.h>
#include <sys/socket.h>
#include <string.h>

void eventcb(struct bufferevent *bev, short events, void *ptr)
{
    if (events & BEV_EVENT_CONNECTED) 
    {
        /* We're connected to 127.0.0.1:8080. Ordinarily we'd do
           something here, like start reading or writing. */
    } 
    else if (events & BEV_EVENT_ERROR) 
    {
        /* An error occurred while connecting. */
    }
}

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
    struct event_base *base;
    struct bufferevent *bev;
    struct sockaddr_in sin;

    base = event_base_new();

    memset(&sin, 0, sizeof(sin));
    sin.sin_family = AF_INET;
    sin.sin_addr.s_addr = htonl(0x7f000001); /* 127.0.0.1 */
    sin.sin_port = htons(8080); /* Port 8080 */

    bev = bufferevent_socket_new(base, -1, BEV_OPT_CLOSE_ON_FREE);

    bufferevent_setcb(bev, NULL, NULL, eventcb, NULL);

    if (bufferevent_socket_connect(bev,
        (struct sockaddr *)&sin, sizeof(sin)) < 0) 
    {
        /* Error starting connection */
        bufferevent_free(bev);
        return -1;
    }

    event_base_dispatch(base);
    return 0;
}
```

To compile and run this code, the following command can be used:

gcc -o test test.c -levent
./test

The input for this is in the form of networking data. The data is processed when some specific networking event occurs like when data is ready to be read from the network or when the network is ready to write data, etc. This specific example connects to localhost on port 8080.
