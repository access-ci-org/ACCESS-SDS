Use Case: Cooler is a Python library used for exploring and manipulating large scale genomic interaction matrices such as Hi-C datasets.

Code details and examples:

Code: 
```
import cooler

# Open the .cool file
c = cooler.Cooler('myData.cool')

# The .cool file is a data matrix storing interaction frequencies between genomic loci
# To get the total number of contacts in the file
tot = c.info['sum']

# To get the number of bins in the file
n_bins = c.info['nbins']

# To get the the number of nonzero elements in the file
n_el = c.info['nnz']

# The .cool file also includes genomic coordinates. 
# You can get the chromosome table like so
chroms = c.chromnames

# To interact with the matrix data, use the matrix method.
# This will generate the full Hi-C matrix
mtx = c.matrix(balance=True).fetch('chr1')

```

The input file myData.cool should be a matrix of interaction frequencies between genomic loci obtained from a Hi-C experiment. This file can be obtained directly from your sequencing service, or can be generated from the raw sequencing data using a Hi-C processing pipeline like Juicer or HiC-Pro.

Command to run: `python myscript.py` (Assuming the script is named myscript.py).
