Use Case: PreprocessCore is a library in R used for preprocessing data and providing certain advanced analytics functionalities and pre-processing tasks. 

Code details and examples: 
Code:

1. Load the library:
```R
library(preprocessCore)
```
2. Depending on the use-case, we can use one of the several methods available in preprocessCore. For example, using normalize.quantiles for quantile normalization.
```R
# Create an input matrix
data_matrix <- matrix(rexp(200, rate=.1), ncol=2)

# Perform quantile normalization
normalized_matrix <- normalize.quantiles(data_matrix)
```

In this example, the input is a data matrix where each column is an observation and each row is a variable. The function normalize.quantiles() from the preprocessCore library is used to perform quantile normalization.

Command to run the code:

The above script can be run in R console, R script or in RStudio. 
Remember `normalize.quantiles` function interprets the data in the matrix columns as observations and rows as variables. 

input file: none
format required: matrix is created within R environment. 
The example here is a small 2 column matrix, in real use cases the matrix can have hundreds or thousands of columns each typically representing different samples or conditions.
