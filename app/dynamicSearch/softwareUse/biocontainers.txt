Use Case: BioContainers is an open-source and community-driven framework which provides the infrastructure necessary for the creation, management and distribution of bioinformatics containers. These are ready-to-use software packages that include everything needed to run a piece of software, including the code, a runtime, libraries, environment variables, and config files.

Code details and examples: Code

Given below is an example of usage of a Biocontainers image.

1.Input files:

Here is an example of a FASTQ file that could be used as an input:
```
@SEQ_ID
GATTTGGGGTTCAAAGCAGTATCGATCAAATAGTAAATCCATTTGTTCAACTCACAGTTT
+
!''*((((***+))%%%++)(%%%%).1***-+*''))**55CCF>>>>>>CCCCCCC65
```

2.Format required:

Biocontainers use a variety of formats, as they support many different bioinformatics tools. The format would depend on the specific tool you plan to use. For instance, for sequence analysis tools, the common formats are FASTQ, SAM/BAM for NGS data, PDB for protein structures, etc.

3.Any specifications and details in input files:

The specific details depend greatly on the tool being used. For NGS tools, quality scores, sequences, and sequence identifiers would be essential.

4.Code snippets:
```
#!/bin/bash
docker pull biocontainers/bwa:v0.7.17-3-deb_cv1
docker run biocontainers/bwa:v0.7.17-3-deb_cv1 bwa mem <reference_genome.fa> <read1.fq> <read2.fq>
```

In this case, the names reference_genome.fa, read1.fq, and read2.fq should be replaced by your actual file names.

Command to run:
```
# pull the biocontainers image
docker pull biocontainers/bwa:v0.7.17-3-deb_cv1
# run the software from the container
docker run biocontainers/bwa:v0.7.17-3-deb_cv1 bwa mem <reference_genome.fa> <read1.fq> <read2.fq>
```

This will run the bwa mem algorithm for aligning sequencing reads against a reference genome. The reference genome and the sequencing reads are to be provided by the user in the form of .fa and .fq files respectively.
