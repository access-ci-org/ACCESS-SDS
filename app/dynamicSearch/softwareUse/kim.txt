Use Case: Kim is an open-source library for the modeling of materials. It is often used for atomistic simulations, developing interatomic models and performing quality assessments. 

Code Details and Examples: 

Kim uses both a programming and command-line interface. The kimspec.edn file is used to configure and store Kim properties. You can create and edit this file according to your input requirements.

Input File: kimspec.edn
Format Required: EDN (Extensible Data Notation) 
Specifications and Details in Input Files: This file specifies properties like model, test, and driver.

Example of a kimspec.edn file:

```edn
{:kim-api-build-config
 {:cmake-executable "/usr/bin/cmake"
  :kim-api-cmake-cxx-compiler ""
  :kim-api-cmake-c-compiler ""
  :kim-api-cmake-fortran-compiler ""
  :kim-api-model-list "All"
  :kim-api-tests-list []
  :kim-api-cmake-cache-file-dir ""
  :kim-api-cmake-generators "Unix Makefiles"
  :kim-api-ccmake-curses-version? false
  :kim-api-cmake-version {:major 3 :minor 10 :patch 2 :tweak ""}
  :kim-api-install-prefix "/tmp/kim-api-installation"
  :kim-api-build-dir "/tmp/kim-api-build"
  :kim-api-install-id ""
  :kim-api-system-config-file-dir "/etc/kim-api-v2"
  :kim-api-user-config-file-dir (str (System/getProperty "user.home") "/.kim-api-v2")}
}
```

Command to run Kim: 

After you've set up your .edn file, you can use the Kim models in your simulation code and run it using your compiler.

For example, if you're using c++:

```bash
g++ -std=c++11 -o my_program my_program.cpp -lkim-api
./my_program
```

This would compile and run your code that utilizes the Kim models. In this case, it's assumed that you're using a Unix-like system with g++ installed.
