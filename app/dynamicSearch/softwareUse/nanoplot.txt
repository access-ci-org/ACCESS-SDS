Use Case: NanoPlot is used to visualize various aspects from long-read sequencing data, including quality control, plotting read lengths, and mapping rates.

Code details and examples:

Code:

NanoPlot is called from the command line. 

Command Line Interface (CLI) command:
```bash
NanoPlot --fastq reads.fastq --loglength -o output_directory
```
Input file format:
NanoPlot requires a FASTQ or BAM formatted file as input. The input file should contain the sequencing reads.

Input file example (FASTQ format):
```
@SEQ_ID
GATTTGGGGTTCAAAGCAGTATCGATCAAATAGTAAATCCATTTGTTCAACTCACAGTTT
+
!''*((((***+))%%%++)(%%%%).1***-+*''))**55CCF>>>>>>CCCCCCC65
```
Note: "@" is a sequence identifier, the second line is a sequence of nucleotides, "+" is a quality score identifier, and the final line is a quality score string.

Description:
Reads.fastq is the input file which contains your sequencing data. The "--loglength" argument tells NanoPlot to create a logarithmic plot of read length. "-o output_directory" is the directory where NanoPlot outputs the plots.
