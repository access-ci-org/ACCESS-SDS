Use Case: libxcb is an interface to the X Window System protocol, which allows client programs to communicate with an X server. It is mainly used in graphic applications, window managers, and system monitors.

Code details and examples: Code: 

In libxcb, you usually send requests via functions and receive responses via events. Here is an example to open a window:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <xcb/xcb.h>

int
main ()
{
  /* Open the connection to the X server. Use the DISPLAY environment variable */

  int screenNum;
  xcb_connection_t *connection = xcb_connect (NULL, &screenNum);

  /* Get the screen whose number is screenNum */

  const xcb_setup_t *setup = xcb_get_setup (connection);
  xcb_screen_iterator_t iter = xcb_setup_roots_iterator (setup);

  for (int i = 0; i < screenNum; ++i) {
    xcb_screen_next (&iter);
  }

  xcb_screen_t *screen = iter.data;

  /* Create the window */

  xcb_window_t window;
  window = screen->root;

  xcb_create_window (connection,                  // Connection
                     XCB_COPY_FROM_PARENT,        // depth (same as root)
                     window,                      // window Id
                     screen->root,                // parent window
                     0, 0,                        // x, y
                     150, 150,                    // width, height
                     10,                          // border_width
                     XCB_WINDOW_CLASS_INPUT_OUTPUT, // class
                     screen->root_visual,         // visual
                     0, NULL);                    // masks, not used yet

  /* Map the window on the screen */

  xcb_map_window (connection, window);

  /* Ensure commands are sent before we pause so that the window gets shown */

  xcb_flush (connection);

  pause ();    /* hold client until Ctrl-C */

  return 0;
}
```   
To compile this code, you need to include the libxcb library:

```bash
gcc -lxcb -o program program.c
```

And to run:

```bash
./program
```

This will open a new window. There are no input files or specifications required for this. However, please ensure that your computer is equipped with an X server, e.g., by running a Linux desktop or using XQuartz on a Mac.

Also, the source code file "program.c" needs to be there in the same directory where the gcc command will be run.
