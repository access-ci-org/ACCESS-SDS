Use Case: ivar is a bioinformatics software used for analyzing viral amplicon-based sequencing data. It creates a consensus sequence and finds variants from aligned reads in a BAM file.

Code details and examples: 

Code:

```bash
# Step 1: Creating primer trimmed BAM
ivar trim -b primers.bed -p trimmed -i input.bam

# Step 2: Removing reads with quality less than 20
samtools view -b -F 4 -q 20 trimmed.bam -o reads.bam 

# Step 3: Creating consensus sequence
samtools mpileup -A -d 0 -Q 0 reads.bam | ivar consensus -p consensus -n N -q 20 -m 1
```

Input File:

- BAM file (input.bam): Binary sequence alignment/map file generated by aligning raw reads to a reference genome using any aligner such as BWA or Bowtie2. BAM format specification can be found at https://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/SAMv1.pdf

- Bed file (primers.bed): Contains the genomic regions where the primers will be applied. It is in the standard Bed file format with columns for chromosome name, start position, and end position.

Specifications:

- Consensus sequence minimum depth is set to 1.
- Consensus sequence quality threshold is set to 20.
- Non-ATGC bases are represented as N.
