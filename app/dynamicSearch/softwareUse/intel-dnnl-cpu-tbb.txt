Use Case: Deep learning inference with Intel oneAPI Deep Neural Network Library (DNNL) on CPU using Threading Building Blocks (TBB)

Code details and examples:
Input files:
- Model file (e.g., model.xml): A file containing the deep learning model architecture
- Weights file (e.g., weights.bin): A file containing the trained weights of the deep learning model
- Input data file (e.g., input_data.npy): A file containing input data for inference

Code:
```bash
dnnl_cpu_tbb --model model.xml --weights weights.bin --input input_data.npy
```

Note: This is a hypothetical command structure as an example for running deep learning inference with Intel DNNL on CPU using TBB. The actual command may vary based on the specific implementation and setup.
