Use Case: GimmeMotifs is a computational motif discovery tool used to find motifs in sets of co-regulated or similarly annotated genomic sequences. It predicts potential transcription factor binding sites and helps in situations when you don't know the transcription factor, but you have a set of genomic regions.

Code details and examples:

Code snippet to generate predictions of motifs, here is example code in Python:

```python
from gimmemotifs.motif import read_motifs
# Read motifs from a file
motifs = read_motifs("motifs.pfm")
# Consider first 5 motifs
motifs = motifs[:5]
# First motif
print(motifs[0].id)
print(motifs[0].to_pwm())
# Access as dictionary
for motif in motifs:
    print(motif["id"])
```

Input file: The input to this tool is a FASTA file that contains sequences for motif prediction. The FASTA file typically has the format:

```
>sequence_1
ATGCGTATCGT
>sequence_2
CGTACGTACGTA
...
```

Command to run: To run GimmeMotifs from the command line, once sequences are saved in a FASTA file "sequence.fasta", use the following command to discover motifs:

```bash
gimme motifs sequence.fasta output_directory
```

It produces an HTML report in output_directory that contains the discovered motifs and information about them. The result directory also contains a variety of output files, including genomic locations for discovered motifs, ranking graphics for comparison with known motifs, a table with sequence-based features, and others.
