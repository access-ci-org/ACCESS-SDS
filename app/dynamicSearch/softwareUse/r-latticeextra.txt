Use Case: The R LatticeExtra package can be used in various scenarios where comprehensive plots and graphs are needed. These situations often happen in the field of data analysis and statistics, where data can be best understood when visualized. As an add-on package to Lattice, LatticeExtra provides additional functionality to enhance the plots, including layering and extended color schemes. 

Code Details and Examples:

Data Requirements: For illustrating the use of LatticeExtra, we are going to use inbuilt R dataset "mtcars"

```
# Loading necessary libraries
library(latticeExtra)

# Create a Basic Histogram
histogram( ~ mpg, data = mtcars, 
main = "Miles Per Gallon", 
xlab = "Miles Per Gallon", 
border = "black", 
col="darkblue",
breaks=15)

# Adding a density plot to the histogram
histogram(~mpg, data=mtcars, border="black", col="darkblue", breaks=15) + 
densityplot(~mpg, data=mtcars, plot.points = FALSE, col = "red")
```
Command to run: This code can be executed directly in R interpreter or RStudio environment.

NOTE: In the above code snippet, the `densityplot()` function from LatticeExtra is layered over `histogram()` to display a density estimate overlay on the histogram.
