Use Case: HiC-Pro is a bioinformatics software package developed for the processing of Hi-C data, from raw reads to normalized contact maps. The pipeline manages different steps including read mapping, quality controls, interaction scores, and contact matrices. 

Code details and examples: Code

1. Input Files and format for HiC-Pro
   The main input files for HiC-Pro are FastQ files. Here is the sample input file and format.

   Read 1: File1_r1.fastq
   Read 2: File1_r2.fastq

   An example of FastQ file format is as follows.
   ```
   @SEQ_ID
   GATTTGGGGTTCAAAGCAGTATCGATCAAATAGTAAATCCATTTGTTCAACTCACAGTTT
   +
   !''*((((***+))%%%++)(%%%%).1***-+*''))**55CCF>>>>>>CCCCCCC65
   ```

2. Configuration File.
   You need to create a configuration file with naming `hicpro.config` before running HiC-Pro. This file contains all parameters and paths required for HiC-Pro. 

   Here are some part of `hicpro.config` looks like
   ```
   [bwt2_index]
   GENOME_INDEX = /path/to/genome/index

   [bwt2_options]
   bwt2_opts = --very-sensitive
   ```
   
3. Command to run HiC-Pro
   Once the configuration file is ready, You can execute HiC-Pro with following command.
   ```
   HiC-Pro -i /path/to/data -o /path/to/output -c hicpro.config
   ```

4. Code Snippet
   Here is a brief code snippet to show how you might use HiC-Pro.
   ```
   # Navigate to the working directory
   cd /path/to/data

   # Run HiC-Pro
   HiC-Pro -i . -o /path/to/output -c hicpro.config
   ```

**Please watch out for directory paths** as HiC-Pro uses absolute paths and always requires trailing slashes.
