Use Case: GenomicConsensus is a software package that is used for generating consensus sequences from the alignments of high quality, long, and short DNA reads.

Code details and examples:

Code:
```
# Sample input files
# Example of a BAM file (input file for read alignments)
# "sample.bam"

# Example of a FASTA file (reference sequence)
# "reference.fasta"

# note: these files are usually large and complex in structure, 
# so they're not practically reproduced here.

# Input Format Specification
# GenomicConsensus requires alignments in a BAM file for the reads and 
# a reference sequence in a FASTA file.

# Details in Input Files
# The BAM file should contain the aligned reads from any sequence alignment
# tool, and the FASTA file should have the reference sequences the reads 
# were aligned against.

# Example Command
# Quiver is one of the modules of GenomicConsensus for generating 
# consensus sequence from Pac Bio reads. 

pbtools genomicconsensus quiver sample.bam -r reference.fasta -o "output.fasta"
```

This will produce a consensus sequence "output.fasta", which is base-called from your "sample.bam" according to the "reference.fasta". Output will be in FASTA format. If required, other consensus algorithms like `Arrow` and `Plurality` can be used in place of `Quiver`. Remember, the "sample.bam" and "reference.fasta" files used here are not included because these files are complex and large, they are just used to show how the command line works.
