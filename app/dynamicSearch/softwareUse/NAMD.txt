Use Case: NAMD is used for high-performance simulations of large biomolecular systems. 

Code details and examples: Code

Input file

NAMD was developed to simulate not only protein systems but also arbitrary systems designed by the user. The primary user control file, typically named config.namd, is a plain text file specifying the parameters for the system to be simulated. Here is a simple example of a NAMD config file:

structure data.psf
coordinates start.pdb
outputName output.xyz
paraTypeCharmm on
parameters parameters.prm
exclude scaled1-4
1-4scaling 1.0
cutoff 14.0
switching on
switchdist 10.0
pairlistdist 16.0
numsteps 10000
timestep 1.0
rigidBonds all
rigidTolerance 0.00001
deformation on

NOTE: Simplified from an example configuration file available at: http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Training/Tutorials/namd/general-tutorial-files/config.namd

The coordinate file is in PDB format:
ATOM      1  N   ALA A 283       7.325  16.769  12.633  1.00 50.31           N  
ATOM      2  CA  ALA A 283       8.286  17.806  12.921  1.00 49.02           C  
ATOM      3  C   ALA A 283       8.287  18.263  14.396  1.00 49.02           C  

Command to Run

The NAMD binary can be launched directly from command line with a configuration file as input. Replace 'namd2' and 'config.namd' with the appropriate names for your installation and configuration file:

namd2 +p4 config.namd > output.log

Where +p4 indicates the use of 4 processors for the simulation and output log file stores the standard output.
