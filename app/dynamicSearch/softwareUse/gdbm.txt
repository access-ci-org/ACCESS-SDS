Use Case: Use gdbm (GNU dbm) is a database storing key-value pairs. It's a simple data storage format commonly used in Unix-based systems due to its simplicity and efficiency.

Code Details and Examples: Code

In Python, the gdbm library can be used as follows:

```Python
import gdbm

# Create a new database or open an existing one
d = gdbm.open('mydatabase', 'c')

# Store a key-value pair
d['key'] = 'value'

# Retrieve the value of a key
value = d['key']
print(value) # Outputs: value

# Close the database
d.close()
```

The `open` method requires a filename and a flag as input parameters. The filename refers to the file to be used as the database. The flag specifies the mode in which to open the file: 'r' for read-only, 'w' for read and write, 'c' for create (opens the file for reading and writing, and creates it if it does not exist), and 'n' for new (always creates a new database).

Command to run the file:

If the above Python code is saved in a file named `gdbm_example.py`, it can be run with the following shell command:
```Shell
python3 gdbm_example.py
```
