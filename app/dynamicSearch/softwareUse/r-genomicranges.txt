Use Case: The Bioconductor package GenomicRanges is used to represent and manipulate genomic intervals and variables defined along a genome. It's widely used in Bioinformatics pipelines for DNA or RNA sequencing data analysis. 
   
Code Details and Examples: 

Structure of the input file: The typical input would be a CSV or similar file format containing genomic coordinates. For example, an input bed file is required. The input `bed` could look like this:

```
chr1    10    100
chr1    120   150
chr2    20    300
```

Code: 

To use GenomicRanges in R, you create a Granges object with the genomic intervals like this: 

```R
# load GenomicRanges
library(GenomicRanges)

# create a Granges object representing genomic intervals
gr <- GRanges(
  seqnames = Rle(c("chr1", "chr1", "chr2")),
  ranges = IRanges(start = c(10, 120, 20), end = c(100, 150, 300)))
  
# print the granges object
print(gr)
```

Command to run: 

This code would typically be run in an R environment, either an IDE like RStudio or command-line R. The command to run an R script is usually `Rscript script.R`.

Please note that the Rle function used in the example creates a run-length encoded vector of the input, a useful data structure for this kind of data. And the GRanges create a Granges object representing genomic intervals.
