Use Case: INQ is a software for computational material physics which can be used for performing quantum mechanics based simulations. It computes electronic structures and energies of systems, as well as other properties.

Code and examples:

1. Here is a sample INQ input file for a silicon-like system, where the primitive cell contains two atoms, each at the origin.

Code:
```bash
BEGIN_PROJECT
  PROJECT_NAME si
  SAVEWAVE true
  RESTART false
END_PROJECT

BEGIN_CONTROL
  TIMESTEP 0.05_recentime
  RUNTYPE GS
  TOLINTEG 1.0e-4
  NUMSTEP 20000
  WFTOL 1.0e-6
END_CONTROL

BEGIN_GEOMETRY
  NATOM 2
  NTYPE 1
  ATOMIC_SPECIES si 28.085 Si_RECPOT
  BEGIN_UNIT_CELL_BOHR
  0.0 2.715 2.715
  2.715 0.0 2.715
  2.715 2.715 0.0
  END_UNIT_CELL_BOHR
  TOTAL_ELECTRON 8.0 
  BEGIN_POS_BOHR
  si 0.0 0.0 0.0
  END_POS_BOHR
END_GEOMETRY

BEGIN_PSEUDO_POTENTIAL
  PSEUDO_TYPE norm_conserving
  ZVALENCE 1.0
  LMAX 1
  RCUT 2.0
END_PSEUDO_POTENTIAL
```
To run the simulation, the following command can be used:
```bash
mpiexec -n [number-of-cores] inq input.inq > output.log
```
Here, "[number-of-cores]" has to be replaced with the number of CPU cores one wishes to use for the simulation.

Specifications: 

- For the project section, "project_name" corresponds to the name of the project, "savewave" is the flag to save the wavefunction or not, and "restart" is the flag to start from a previous wave function or not.
- For the control section, users can set the calculation parameters such as timestep, runtype (GS for ground state), numer of steps, etc.
- For the geometry section, users have to provide details about the system such as number of atoms (natom), atomic species, unit cell parameters, etc.
- The pseudopotential section contains parameters for the pseudopotential used on the atoms.
