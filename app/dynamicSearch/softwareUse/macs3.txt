Use Case: MACS3 (Model-based Analysis for ChIP-Seq), is a bioinformatics tool used to identify transcript factor binding sites in ChIP-Seq data. This tool is commonly used for analyzing high-throughput sequencing data.

Code details and examples:

Code:

Input:
A couple of aligned .bam files for ChIP and control experiments. You can also use .sam, .bed, or .elnd files.

Format required: 
Sequence file in BAM, SAM, BED, or ELND format

Example input files:
1. chip.bam : The alignment results of ChIP sample
2. control.bam : The alignment results of Control sample

Specifications in input files:
The BAM files must be sorted; the peaks are reported with 1-based coordinates.

Command to run it: 

    macs3 callpeak -t chip.bam -c control.bam -f BAM -g hs -n test -B -q 0.01

  Here the `-t` option specifies the treatment file (ChIP), `-c` specifies the control file, `-f` specifies the file format, `-g` specifies the effective genome size (human), `-n` is for naming the run, `-B` tells MACS to store read distribution and `-q` is for setting the q-value cutoff.

This command will generate various files such as a bedgraph file of pileup signals, a peak file in narrowPeak format, xls file with peak locations, summits, height, etc.

The output .narrowPeak file can be loaded directly to the UCSC genome browser. Remove the beginning track line if you want to analyze it by bedtools or other software.
