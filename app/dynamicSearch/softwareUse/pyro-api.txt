Use Case: Pyro API is useful for probabilistic programming applications. It allows flexible modelling and inference of probabilistic models.
  
Code details and examples:

Code:

First, import necessary functions and libraries.

```python
import torch
from pyroapi import pyro_backend
from pyroapi import distributions as dist
from pyroapi import handlers
from pyroapi import infer
from pyroapi import optim
from pyroapi import pyro
```
Now, we define a simple probabilistic model using the Pyro modeling language.
```python
def weather():
    cloudy = pyro.sample('cloudy', dist.Bernoulli(0.3))
    cloudy = 'cloudy' if cloudy.item() == 1.0 else 'sunny'
    mean_temp = {'cloudy': 55.0, 'sunny': 75.0}[cloudy]
    scale_temp = {'cloudy': 10.0, 'sunny': 15.0}[cloudy]
    temp = pyro.sample('temp', dist.Normal(mean_temp, scale_temp))
    return cloudy, temp.item()
```
From the above model we can generate some samples in this way :
```python
print(weather())
```
The "weather" is a straightforward function that returns two objects under different circumstances.
    
Command to run:

You would typically run this in a python environment. The command to run would be:

```bash
python filename.py
``` 
Make sure to replace "filename.py" with the name of your python file.

Please note that Pyro does not take specific input files. The input to the model is defined within the code itself.
