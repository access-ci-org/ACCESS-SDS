Use Case: libwebp is typically used to convert images to the WebP format for smaller file sizes while maintaining a similar level of quality. 

Code details and examples: 

Code: 

The command line tool is simple to use. The basic usage is `cwebp input_image -o output_image.webp`. Here's a more detailed example:

```bash
cwebp -q 80 input.jpg -o output.webp
```

Here, `-q` sets the quality factor, which ranges from 0 to 100. Higher values will result in larger files, but better image quality.

The input file should be an image in one of the formats that cwebp supports, such as JPEG, PNG, or TIFF. The output file will be the converted image in WebP format.

To decode the WebP image back into a more traditional format, you can use the `dwebp` command:

```bash
dwebp input.webp -o output.png
```

libwebp also provides an API for developers who wish to add WebP support to their applications. This typically involves including the relevant header files in your source code and linking against the libwebp library. The input can be any image data that your application can produce, while the output will be the WebP-encoded image data. Use of the API generally involves calls to functions such as `WebPEncodeRGB`, `WebPEncodeBGR`, or similar. Ex:

```c
#include <webp/encode.h>

// ...

uint8_t* img_data; /* Your RGB image data */
int width, height; /* Dimensions of your image */

uint8_t* webp_data; /* Output WebP image data */
size_t webp_data_size;

WebPConfig config;
if (!WebPConfigInit(&config)) {
  /* Handle error */
}

if (!WebPConfigLosslessPreset(&config, 9)) {
  /* Handle error */
}

config.method = 6;

if (!WebPValidateConfig(&config)) {
  /* Handle error */
}

WebPPicture pic;
if (!WebPPictureInit(&pic)) {
  /* Handle error */
}

pic.width = width;
pic.height = height;
if (!WebPPictureImportRGB(&pic, img_data, width * 3)) {
  /* Handle error */
}

pic.writer = WebPMemoryWrite;
pic.custom_ptr = &webp_data;

if (!WebPEncode(&config, &pic)) {
  /* Handle error */
}

/* At this point, webp_data contains your WebP image data, and
   pic.custom_ptr contains the size of the data. */

WebPPictureFree(&pic);
```
