Use Case: Use Make to build and install your programs from source code. It is a useful tool that automatically figures out which pieces of a larger system need to be re-compiled, and issues the necessary commands to re-compile them. 

Code Details and Examples: 

To use Make, you need to write a Makefile, which is a simple text file that tells Make how to compile and link a program.

A Makefile contains a set of directives that describe the dependencies among files in your program and provides commands for updating each file.

An example of a makefile: 

```makefile
helloworld: helloworld.o
    gcc -o helloworld helloworld.o

helloworld.o: helloworld.c
    gcc -c helloworld.c

clean:
    rm helloworld.o helloworld
```

In this Makefile,

1. `helloworld` is the target, and `helloworld.o` its dependency. If `helloworld.o` is modified, `make` will rebuild `helloworld`.

2. `helloworld.o` is the target, and `helloworld.c` the dependency. If `helloworld.c` is updated, `make` will rebuild `helloworld.o`.

3. `-c` tells gcc to compile the .c file into an object file (.o) but not link it.

4. The `clean` target is a conventional target for removing compiled files from the directory.

The command used to run this file is: `make helloworld`


Remember, make is not always used for compiling C/C++ programs and can be used to build and automate various tasks in a programming language. It's just that, it is most commonly used for this use case.
