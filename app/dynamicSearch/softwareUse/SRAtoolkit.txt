Use Case: Use SRA Toolkit for retrieving and processing next-generation sequencing data from NCBI's Sequence Read Archive (SRA). It also facilitates the conversion of SRA data into other formats for ease of analysis.

Code details and examples:

Code:

Input file format: .sra
Command to run:
```
fastq-dump <SRA file>
```
This will convert the .sra file to a .fastq file. For example, if your SRA file is named SRR390728.sra, the command will be
```
fastq-dump SRR390728.sra
```
Important specification: The input file (.sra) is typically obtained from the Sequence Read Archive database.

NCBI recommends using prefetch to download SRA files, for example:
```
prefetch SRR390728
``` 
This will download SRA file SRR390728.sra into your current directory. The file can then be converted to .fastq format using fastq-dump as mentioned above.
