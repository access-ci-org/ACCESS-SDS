Use Case: Use cisTEM for performing high-resolution cryo-electron microscopy analysis. 

Code details and examples: Code.

Input files:
Requirements: A set of aligned micrographs or particle stacks in .mrc/MRC format.

1. Micrograph files are typically named as mic*.mrc, where * is the number of micrographs.
2. Particle stack files are named as particle*.mrc.

Sample Filenames:
1. mic_001.mrc
2. particle_stack.mrc

Command to Run:

The GUI (Graphical User Interface) way to run cisTEM is to execute
```
cistem 
```
On running this command the GUI panel of cisTEM will open. 

For command line, the commands are of format: 
```
cistem command_name --first_parameter value --second_parameter value ...
```

For instance, to run an ab initio 3D reconstruction command for particle stack is:
```
cistem ab-initio-3d --input_stack particle_stack.mrc --output_star_file output.star
```
Above command will initiate an "Ab-Initio 3D" job using particle_stack.mrc as the input stack and create a output.star file that can be used for later high-resolution refinement.

Specifications and Details in Input files:

1. Micrograph file (mic_001.mrc): It's an MRC file which contains a 2D image of a micrograph.
  
2. Particle stack file (particle_stack.mrc): It's an MRC file which has a 3D array of particles extracted from the micrograph. Each Z-slice of the volume represents a single particle.

Codes snippets are typically not required as cisTEM is a software package designed to be operated via GUI or command-line without coding. However, for batch processing or automating tasks, one can write bash or python scripts to sequentially execute cisTEM commands.
