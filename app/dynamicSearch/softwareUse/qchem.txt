Use Case: Quantum Chemistry calculations

Code Details and Examples:

Code:

The input file for QChem is usually a .inp file, defined by the user. A simple Sample might be:

$comment
Jobtype: SP method: HF basis: 6-31G*
$end

$molecule
0 1
O
H 1 R
H 1 R 2 A
$end

$rem
JOBTYPE = SP
METHOD = hf
BASIS = 6-31g*
$end

In the defined example, the molecule is defined in Z-Matrix format. The parameters R and A are bond length and angle, respectively. The JOBTYPE, METHOD, and BASIS are self-explanatory. 


Command to Run:

In Linux systems, to submit a job, you use the command:

qchem inputfile.inp outputfile.out

For the Above example:

qchem example.inp example.out

Please note that the above details can change based on the version of QChem and different features and functionality other versions may offer.
