Use Case: To create an encrypted file system with cryptsetup. This software is frequently used in secure server environments in order to prevent information from being easily extracted from physical storage media.

Code details and examples:

File Name: cryptsetup-command.txt

Format Required: Plaintext file with Command 

Specifications and Details: 

In this particular use case, we will create an encrypted file system on `/dev/sdb1` and will use the password `mysecretpassword`.

- To create the encrypted file system:
```
echo -n "mysecretpassword" | cryptsetup luksFormat /dev/sdb1 -
```

- Next, you unlock /dev/sdb1
```
echo -n "mysecretpassword" | cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/sdb1 secret_volume -
```

- Then, you can format the device:
```
mkfs.ext4 /dev/mapper/secret_volume
```

- After usage, make sure to lock the device again for security:
```
cryptsetup luksClose secret_volume
```

Command to Run: The commands themselves need to be run in a Unix-based terminal. Please make sure all commands are run with root or sudo permissions, and replace the `/dev/sdb1` path with the path where you wish to create your encrypted file system as well as replace `mysecretpassword` by your own secure password. 

Please remember that encryption provides a certain level of security which is vastly dependent on the complexity of your password. For production environment you should use a stronger method to provide password to cryptsetup, rather using echo command.
