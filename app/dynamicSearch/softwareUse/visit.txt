Use Case: VisIt is an Open Source, interactive, scalable, visualization, animation and analysis tool. It can be used for visualizing 2D/3D data from simulations and experiments

Code Details and Examples:

Code:

```python
# Import the VisIt module
import visit

# Connect to the VisIt server
visit.Launch()

# Open a database
visit.OpenDatabase("localhost:./wave.visit")

# Add a plot
visit.AddPlot("Pseudocolor", "pressure")

# Draw the plot
visit.DrawPlots()

# Set the view
v = visit.GetView3D()
v.viewNormal = (-0.897, 0.395, 0.199)
v.focus = (5, 0, 30)
v.viewUp = (0.213, 0.917, -0.337)
v.viewAngle = 30
v.parallelScale = 16.3789
v.nearPlane = 1.20711
v.farPlane = 70.153
v.imageZoom = 1
v.perspective = 1
v.eyeAngle = 2
visit.SetView3D(v)

# Save the image
visit.SaveWindow()
```

Command to run:

```batch
visit -cli -s script.py
```

Input file format required:

- The .visit file is an ASCII file specifying a list of VTK files (or other types)

Note: 

- The python script must be accompanied by a .visit file, which is a text file that lists one or more files that should be considered to be part of the same logical dataset. For example, the wave.visit file might include: wave0.vtk, wave1.vtk, wave2.vtk, etc.
- The .vtk files contain the actual data to be visualized. These files can contain scalar, vector, or tensor data, grid definitions, and additional metadata. The VTK file format supports a variety of data types, and it is scalable to support large datasets. 

Please refer to the official VTK file format specification for detailed instructions on creating .vtk files:
