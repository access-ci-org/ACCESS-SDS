Use Case: KisSplice2RefGenome provides a solution to identify and analyze RNA-Seq data to study variants, including SNPs and alternative splicing events. It allows the user to map the results of KisSplice (a software to detect RNA variants from RNA-seq data) to a reference genome, and sorts the variants into several categories like canonical, atypical, complex and local splicing.

Code Details and Examples:
Code:

Input Files:
The required input files are mainly FASTA and GFF/GTF formats. 

1. KisSplice results (.fa file): This is essentially a FASTA file that contains the sequence data of RNA variants detected by KisSplice.
2. Reference genome (.fasta/.fa file): This is the reference genome sequence file.
3. Gene annotation file (.gff/.gtf file): This is a file that contains the information about the genes and their locations on the genome.

Command to run:
The command to run Kissplice2refgenome is:

```Bash
python2.7 k2rg.py -i kisSplice_results.fa -f reference_genome.fasta -a annotation.gtf 
```
1. '-i' option is for the KisSplice output file.
2. '-f' option is for the reference genome in fasta format.
3. '-a' option is for the annotation file in gff/gtf format.

Here, 'kisSplice_results.fa' is the KisSplice output, 'reference_genome.fasta' is the reference genome of your target organism, and 'annotation.gtf' is the gene annotation file. 

It is important to note that all files need to be in appropriate format and directories. The output includes several files that contain categorized results (eg: canonical, atypical etc.), which will further aid in the study of RNA variants.

Note: Usual bioinformatics data analysis pipeline checks, including correct file formats (.fasta/.gff/.gtf) and correct Python version (2.7) apply here.

This software package does not provide code snippets for detailed understanding. Instead, it encompasses an end-to-end solution for mapping RNA-Seq variant data to a reference genome and classifying them into various splicing event categories.
