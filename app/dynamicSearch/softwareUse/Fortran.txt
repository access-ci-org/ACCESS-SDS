Use Case: Use Fortran to calculate the sum of integers from 1 to n.

Code details and examples: The input file should be a simple text file containing a single integer representing the number n up to which you want to calculate the sum.

Input File (input.txt) Format:

```
10
```

Code Snippet:

```fortran
! Fortran program to calculate sum
PROGRAM SumCalculation
    IMPLICIT NONE
    INTEGER :: n, sum, i
    OPEN(UNIT=10, FILE='input.txt')
    READ(10, *) n
    sum = 0
    DO i=1, n
        sum = sum + i
    END DO
    PRINT*, sum
END PROGRAM SumCalculation
```

Command to run:

```bash
$ gfortran sum_calculation.f90 -o sum_calculation
$ ./sum_calculation
``` 

This program reads an integer n from the file 'input.txt', calculates sum of integers from 1 to n and prints the result.
