Use Case: Nanopolish is a software tool for signal-level analysis of Oxford Nanopore sequencing data. It is commonly used for the detection of base modifications, for improving consensus accuracy, and for resolving complex structural variations.

Code Details and Examples:

1. Nanopolish variant calling
   Code: 
   ```bash
   nanopolish variants --consensus -o polished.vcf -w "chr20:5,000,000-5,010,000" -r reads.fasta -b reads.sorted.bam -g reference.fa -t 4 --ploidy 2 
   ```
2. Nanopolish methylation calling
   Code:
   ```bash
   nanopolish call-methylation -r reads.fasta -b reads.sorted.bam -g reference.fa -t 4 > methylation_calls.tsv
   ```
3. Nanopolish event alignment
   Code:
   ```bash
   nanopolish eventalign -r reads.fasta -b reads.sorted.bam -g reference.fa -t 4 --scale-events > alignment.tsv
   ```

Input files used in these commands:

- "reads.fasta" is a file containing the raw sequencing reads in FASTA or FASTQ format
- "reads.sorted.bam" is the alignment of the raw reads to the reference genome in BAM format
- "reference.fa" is the reference genome in FASTA format
- Output files like "polished.vcf", "methylation_calls.tsv", "alignment.tsv" are the output generated by the different nanopolish modules

Specifications for the files:
 
- The BAM file should be sorted and indexed.
- The reference file used in alignment should be the same used in variant or methylation calling.
- The ploidy level should be set correctly for accurate variant calling.
