Use Case: PhiPack is a set of command line programs used for analyzing patterns of polymorphism in DNA sequences. It is particularly useful for identifying signature of recombination including population recombination rate. 

Code Details and Examples: 

The main module in PhiPack is Phi. The input to Phi is an aligned DNA sequences file in NEXUS, PHYLIP, MEGA, or FASTA format. The output is a file containing test statistics and sites inferred to be recombination breakpoint. 

For example, this is how a sample input file (in FASTA format) might look:

```

>Seq1
ATGGCTCACATAGCTTATGCATGGCCTACCAGTGTCTTCACGCTCGAGCCCAGCTAGGAC
>Seq2
ATGGCTCACATAACTTATGCATGGCCTACCGGTCTTCACGCTCGAGCCCAGCGAGGAC
>Seq3
ATGGCTCACATAACTTATGCATGGCCTACCGGTCTTCACGCACGAGCCCAGCGAGGAT
```

After creating the input file (e.g., `my_sequences.fasta`), the Phi command can be run as follows:

`Phi -i my_sequences.fasta -f t -o output.txt`

Here `-i` specifies the input file, `-f t` indicates that trace of calculations should be saved, and `-o output.txt` specifies the name of the output file.
