Use Case: Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) is a regression analysis method performing both variable selection and regularization to enhance the prediction accuracy and interpretability of the statistical model it produces. It might be implemented using Python libraries like Scipy or Sklearn.

Code details and examples: 

Code: 

```python

from sklearn import linear_model
import numpy as np

# Sample input files
# X corresponds to the predictors/independent variables dataset.
# Y corresponds to dependent variable dataset.

X = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]])
Y = np.array([1, 2, 3])

# An instance of the Lasso regression model 
lasso_regressor=linear_model.Lasso(alpha=0.1)

# Fit the model
lasso_regressor.fit(X,Y)

# This prints the coefficients of the predictors.
print(lasso_regressor.coef_)

```
The input file for predictors can be a CSV file or an array data structure consisting of numerical data. The input file for the dependent variable can also be a numerical array data input or a CSV file.

The Lasso.method takes two parameters: alpha and max_iter. Alpha is the Constant that multiplies the L1 term. Defaults to 1.0. max_iter is the maximum number of iterations. 

To run this code snippet, you require the Scikit-learn and numpy library installed. Run it in Python compiler. The program would print out the coefficient of the predictors. Remember, the Lasso regression method is useful for feature selection. The features with coefficient = 0 are the least important to the dependent variable and can be removed to improve the model's accuracy.
