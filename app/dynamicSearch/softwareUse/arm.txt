Due to the highly broad nature of the request, is it possible to provide more specific software or tools related to ARM? ARM is primarily a type of processor architecture, so there isn't a specific software or tool that is distinct to ARM, but many software and tools that can work on an ARM processor. For example, it could be ARM toolchain for compiling, GROMACS for molecular dynamics simulations, BWA for bioinformatics sequence alignment, BioPython for biological computation in Python and so forth. Each tool would have a different use case, input format, and code snippets to work with. Please specify the individual software or tools that need instructions or use cases.
