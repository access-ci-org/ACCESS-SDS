Use Case: AdapterRemoval is a program that primarily focuses on the removal of the corrupt adapter sequences from High-Throughput Sequencing (HTS) data. It searches for and removes any residual adapter sequences from the sequences, corrects any forward and reverse pairs, corrects the shift and handles overlapping reads.

Code Details and Examples:

Input File Format: The tool requires paired-end sequencing data as input files. They should be in FastQ format. 

For instance: 
    File 1: forward.fastq 
    File 2: reverse.fastq
    
The files should contain DNA sequences from paired-end sequencing.

Details in Input file: 
FASTQ format follows this structure:
    @Sequence_identifier
    Nucleotide_sequence
    +
    Corresponding_quality_scores

Code:
```
AdapterRemoval --file1 forward.fastq --file2 reverse.fastq --output1 forward.cleaned.fastq --output2 reverse.cleaned.fastq --singleton singleton.fastq --settings settings.log
```

In the above line of command, --file1 and --file2 specify the paired input FastQ files. --output1 and --output2 specify the cleaned forward and reverse output files. --settings stores the runtime settings, statistics and potential error reports of the run.
--singleton is used for output file name containing pair1 reads without a corresponding pair2 read.
