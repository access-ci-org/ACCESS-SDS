Sure I can provide further information but I'll need specific software you would like to know about. As you mentioned, the list includes HPC software, scientific tools, python libraries, bioinformatics software, computational chemistry packages, scientific libraries, compiler tools, etc. So, please provide a few specific software, tools or libraries you want to get details on.
