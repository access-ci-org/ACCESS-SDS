Use Case: GlimmerHMM is used in bioinformatics for gene prediction. It is particularly useful for predicting the genes from eukaryotic genomes such as plants, humans, and animals.

Code Details and Examples:

Code:
```
glimmerhmm <sequence file> -d <trained directory> -o <output file>
```

Input File:
- Sequence file: This should be a file of FASTA format. Let's assume the file name is sequence.fa.

```fasta
>seq1
ATGGCGCGTTAGCGTAGTCGTAGCTGACGTAGTCTGATCGTA
CAGCTGACGACGATGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTGCTAGTAGGCTAG
TAGCTAGCTAGCTAGTCAGCTAGCTAGCGTGACGCTAGCTTG
```

Trained directory: A directory contains the trained model. You can download it from the GlimmerHMM website.

The command to run:

Code:
```
glimmerhmm sequence.fa -d Trained_dir -o output.txt
```
