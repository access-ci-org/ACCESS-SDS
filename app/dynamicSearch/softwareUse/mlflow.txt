Use Case: Experiment Tracking with MLflow

Code Details and Examples:
- MLflow is an open-source platform for managing the end-to-end machine learning lifecycle. It allows tracking experiments, packaging code into reproducible runs, and sharing and deploying models.

1. Create a sample MLflow project:
```python
# my_mlflow_project.py
import mlflow

# Log parameters
mlflow.log_param("param1", 5)
mlflow.log_param("param2", "value2")

# Log metrics
mlflow.log_metric("metric1", 0.85)
mlflow.log_metric("metric2", 0.92)

# Start MLflow run
with mlflow.start_run():
    # Log model
    mlflow.log_artifact("model.pkl")
```

2. Running the MLflow project:
```bash
mlflow run .
```

3. View the MLflow UI to see the results of the experiment tracking:
```bash
mlflow ui
```
