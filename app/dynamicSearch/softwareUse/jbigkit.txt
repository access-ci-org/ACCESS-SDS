Use Case: The jbigkit software package is used for lossless compression of binary images. It is especially effective for bi-level images such as scanned documents, faxes and screenshots.

Code details and examples: Code

Input File: A PBM (portable bitmap) or TIFF (tagged image file format) file is required. For instance, you can have a file named file.pbm or file.tif.

Command to use:

To convert a PBM file to a JBIG file:

```bash
pbmtojbg < file.pbm > output.jbg
```

This command reads the PBM file from the standard input and writes the resulting JBIG file to the standard output.

For reversing this process, i.e., converting a JBIG file back to a PBM file:

```bash
jbgtopbm < output.jbg > original.pbm
```

This command reads the JBIG file from the standard input and writes the resulting PBM file to the standard output.

To decode a JBIG file into a TIFF file:

```bash
jbgtopbm < output.jbg | pbmtotiff -g3 > original.tif
```
This command reads the JBIG file from the standard input, converts it into a PBM file, and then transforms it into a TIFF file using the pbmtotiff tool from the netpbm package, with group 3 fax encoding.

It's important to note that jbigkit does not support color images directly. If you need to compress a color image, you will need to split the color channels and compress them independently.
