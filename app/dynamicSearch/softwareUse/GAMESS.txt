Use Case: The General Atomic and Molecular Electronic Structure System (GAMESS) is a computational chemistry software package that allows for ab initio quantum chemistry computations. GAMESS can be used for studying chemical structures, potential energy surfaces, properties, spectroscopic factors, and more. 

Code details and examples: 

Code:

The input format for GAMESS requires a series of sets of keywords, generally organized by the type of information they provide.

Example: 

    $CONTRL SCFTYP=RHF RUNTYP=ENERGY MULT=1 ICHARG=0 ICUT=11
     INTTYP=POPLE $END
    $SCF DIRSCF=.TRUE. CONV=1d-8 $END
    $SYSTEM TIMLIM=1 MEMORY=1000000 $END
    $BASIS  GBASIS=N311 NGAUSS=6 NDFUNC=1 $END
    $CONTRL COORD=ZMT ISPHER=1 UNITS=ANGS $END
    $GUESS  GUESS=HUCKEL $END
    $DATA

This input file is for a calculation of the energy of Methane. The control options specify the details of the quantum mechanical calculation: Restricted Hartree-Fock (RHF) method, including the basis set (N311 using 6 Gaussians and 1 d-function), integration type (POPLE), charge of the system (neutral), and multiplicity (singlet). The Methane molecule description includes each atom's label, and the x, y, and z coordinates.

Command to run the input file:

    $ gamess < input.inp > output.out

In this example, input.inp is the input file and output.out is the output file.
