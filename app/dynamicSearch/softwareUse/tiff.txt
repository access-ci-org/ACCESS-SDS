img = Image.open('example.tiff')

# Display the image
img.show()
```

Input file:
- Example of an input file for this code would be 'example.tiff', a TIFF image file.

Format required:
- The input file must be in TIFF format.

Specifications and details in input files:
Every TIFF file begins with a two-byte indicator of byte order: "II" for little-endian (a.k.a. "Intel") byte order or "MM" for big-endian (a.k.a "Motorola") byte order.

Command to run (if available):
- N/A. This snippet can be run from a Python IDE or from the command line by executing 'python filename.py', where 'filename.py' is the name of the Python file containing the above code.
