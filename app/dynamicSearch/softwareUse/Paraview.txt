Use Case: Paraview can be used as a visualization tool for data analysis and image rendering. It's widely used in computational physics and engineering for visualizing scientific data sets.

Code Details and Examples:

Code:
```
Output:
OutputFile.pvtk
```

Input:
```
ASCII
DATASET STRUCTURED_GRID
DIMENSIONS 3 3 3
ORIGIN 0 0 0
SPACING 1 1 1
POINT_DATA 27
SCALARS Temperature float
LOOKUP_TABLE default
25 30 55 
30 35 60 
55 60 65 

25 30 55 
30 35 60 
55 60 65 

25 30 55
30 35 60
55 60 65
```

Command to execute:

```bash
paraview --data=OutputFile.pvtk
```

In this example, the data represents a 3x3x3 grid with a scalar field called temperature. The scalar values represent temperature values at the points in the grid.
