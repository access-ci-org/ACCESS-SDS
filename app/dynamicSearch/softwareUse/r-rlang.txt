Use Case: r-rlang is an R library that's meant to provide a set of functions that makes it easier to work with data, making it a fantastic tool for data wrangling, processing, and visualization. For instance, you could use r-rlang for a task involving the manipulation and cleaning of a complex dataset. 

Code details and examples:

Code:

```R
# Assuming that you have a dataframe df
# and df looks something like this:
#       id value
#   1    1     5
#   2    2     6
#   3    3     7

# Let's say you want to add a new column "new_value" to df 
# "new_value" is equal to "value" * 2

# Here's how you do it in R using rlang
library(rlang)

new_value_expr <- expr(value * 2)
df <- mutate(df, new_value := !!new_value_expr)

# Now, df should look something like this:
#       id value new_value
#   1    1     5        10
#   2    2     6        12
#   3    3     7        14
```

In this case, the required input format is a dataframe, which is standard in R for dealing with tabular data. Specifications of the dataframe include an 'id' column and a 'value' column.

This script can be run in R environment by copying and pasting the script or sourcing it from a file. In case of running it from an R-script file (for example, script.R), the command would be `source("script.R")`.
