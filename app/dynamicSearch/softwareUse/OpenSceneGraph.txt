Use Case: OpenSceneGraph is an open-source, highly efficient 3D graphics toolkit. It is used for visual simulations, virtual reality, scientific visualization, and games. 

Code details and examples:

Code: 

```cpp
#include <osg/Node>
#include <osg/Group>
#include <osg/Geode>
#include <osg/Geometry>
#include <osgViewer/Viewer>

int main()
{
    osg::ref_ptr<osg::Group> root = new osg::Group();
    osg::ref_ptr<osg::Geode> geode = new osg::Geode();
    root->addChild(geode);

    osg::ref_ptr<osg::Geometry> geometry = new osg::Geometry();
    geode->addDrawable(geometry);

    osgViewer::Viewer viewer;
    viewer.setSceneData(root);
    return viewer.run();
}
```

This code initializes a basic OpenSceneGraph program. A group node `root` is created which can contain multiple children nodes. A `Geode` is one such child which is a leaf node and can contain drawable objects like `Geometry`. The Viewer is then set with the created scene graph and run.

The input files for OpenSceneGraph typically include 3D model files which come in formats such as `.osg`, `.3ds`, `.obj`, etc. The detailed structure of those files is specified by the associated file format standard and would typically be created using a 3D modeling tool like Blender. 

Command to run the file: 
`g++ -losg -losgViewer -lOpenThreads example.cpp -o example && ./example`
