Use Case: Ghostscript is used to interpret PostScript language and PDF files; create high-quality rasterizations of pages in these formats for print and prepress; display such pages on screen; convert these file types to multiple, popular, image file formats; create bitmap or scalable fonts; etc. 

Code details and examples: Code

Sample Input File: 
You need a Postscript or PDF file to be able to use Ghostscript. It is typically a .ps or .pdf file. Standard format for these files can't be described as they are usually already standard formatted files exported from various software. 

Command:
To use Ghostscript to convert a Postscript file to a PDF, use the following command:
```
gs -sDEVICE=pdfwrite -dCompatibilityLevel=1.4 -dPDFSETTINGS=/default -dNOPAUSE -dQUIET -dBATCH -sOutputFile=output.pdf input.ps
```
Where 'input.ps' is your Postscript input file and 'output.pdf' is the output PDF file name. 

Code Snippets:
A simple PostScript program that draws a red, one-inch square at the bottom left corner of the page is as follows:

```
%!PS
72 72 moveto
0 72 rlineto
72 0 rlineto
0 -72 rlineto
closepath
2 setlinewidth
0.8 setgray
stroke
showpage
```

This will create a square on a page when run with Ghostscript. 

Command to run the code snippet is: 
```
gs square.ps
```
Here 'square.ps' is the name of the file containing the code snippet.
