Document creation in LaTeX typically begins with a template:

```Tex
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}

\title{Sample Document}
\author{John Doe}
\date{April 2021}

\begin{document}

\maketitle

\section{Introduction}

This is a simple document written in LaTeX.

\section{Main text}

This is an example of a section. Sections are used to divide the document into parts.

\end{document}
```
Explanation: 
- `\documentclass{article}`: This command tells LaTeX to format your document as an "article". 
- `\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}`: This command tells LaTeX to use the UTF8 character set, which enables it to understand any character in your document.
- `\title`, `\author`, `\date`: These commands tell LaTeX the title of your document, the author's name, and the date.
- `\maketitle`: This command tells LaTeX to print the title block.
- `\section`: This command is used to create a new section.

Template files ("*.tex") can be run with the 'pdflatex' command to produce output in PDF format.

Command to run the file: Assuming the input file is named "document.tex", you can compile it into a PDF with the following command:

```bash
pdflatex document.tex
```
This will produce a file called `document.pdf`.
