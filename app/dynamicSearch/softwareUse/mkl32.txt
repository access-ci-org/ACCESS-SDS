Use Case: Intel Math Kernel Library (MKL) is a computational package used extensively for high performance computing tasks. It involves utilizing computing resources for tasks requiring mathematical computations like matrix multiplication, Fourier transforms, vector statistics, amongst others.

Code details and examples: Code

Firstly, let's write a simple C code which uses MKL for matrix multiplication.

Complexity (Input & Output File details): The sample file here is a C program (.c file). It needs a compiler and MKL library installed on the machine. The output will be presented on the console (stdout).

```c
#include "mkl.h"

void main()
{
   double A[6] = {1.0, 2.0, 1.0, -3.0, 4.0, -1.0};
   double B[6] = {1.0, 2.0, 1.0, -3.0, 4.0, -1.0};
   double C[9] = {.5, .5, .5, .5, .5, .5, .5, .5, .5};
   cblas_dgemm(CblasRowMajor, CblasNoTrans, CblasTrans, 
               3, 3, 2, 1, A, 2, B, 2, 2, C, 3);
   
   for(int i=0; i<9; i++)
      printf("%lf ", C[i]);
}
```

Command to Run: To compile and run the program first compile the C file with intel C compiler and MKL linking as:

```
icc -o my_program my_program.c -I/opt/intel/mkl/include -L/opt/intel/mkl/lib/intel64 -lmkl_rt -lpthread -lm -ldl
```

Then, you can run the program as:

```
./my_program
```

This should show the resulting matrix after the matrix multiplication operation is performed.
