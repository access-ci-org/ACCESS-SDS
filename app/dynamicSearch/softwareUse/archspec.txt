Use Case: archspec is a library and command-line utility that helps to determine whether software is compatible with a certain system architecture. This is especially useful in large-scale cluster environments, where there are many different systems, and it becomes impractical to manually check software compatibility for each one.

Code Details and Examples: 

Code: 
Python API usage:

```python
import archspec.cpu

cpu = archspec.cpu.host() 

print(f"{cpu}") #This will print the name of the host CPU microarchitecture.
```

Command-line utility usage:

The input to this utility is the `lscpu` commandâ€™s output from the target host.

```bash
lscpu | archspec cpu 
```

The output is the most specific archspec label that matches the `lscpu` output.

Output:

```bash
broadwell
```

No special specification or format is required as input file. It doesn't take a file input but rather commands from the terminal or scripts from a Python program.
