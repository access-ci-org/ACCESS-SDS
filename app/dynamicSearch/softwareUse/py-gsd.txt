Use Case: Use py-gsd for trajectory analysis in molecular dynamics simulation. 

Code Details and Examples: Code

First, py-gsd has a specific format for input files, which are .gsd files. These are binary files that contain molecular dynamics simulation data.

We can visualize a system and explore it by reading a GSD file:

```python
from gsd import hoomd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

# opening the file
t = hoomd.open(name='example.gsd', mode='rb')

# get the last frame
snap = t[-1]

# get the positions of all particles
positions = snap.particles.position

# plotting the positions
plt.scatter(positions[:,0], positions[:,1])
plt.show()
```

Here, 'example.gsd' is the GSD file obtained from a HOOMD simulation. 

The gsd file must be previously generated from a simulation using HOOMD-blue software or any other compatible software. Here, 'example.gsd' is just an example, your gsd file name could be different.

Command to run a '.py' python script file in the Linux terminal:

`python filename.py`

This command runs the script named 'filename.py'. For scripts that require command-line arguments, specify these after the filename.
