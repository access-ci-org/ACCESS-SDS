Use Case: Atomic Simulation Environment (ASE) is a python package and an open source tool designed to help physicists, chemists, and materials scientists to set up, control, and implement the results of atomic-scale simulations.

Code details and examples:

Sample Input file:

An example of a simple Bismuth crystal, here is a python code:

```
from ase.build import bulk
bismuth = bulk("Bi", crystalstructure="rhombohedral", a=4.543, c=11.866)
print(bismuth.get_positions())
```

This script sets up a Bismuth crystal according to the specified parameters, `a` and `c`, which are lattice constants.

It's not a file input but direct input to the script. The `print()` statement will return the position of each atom.

Command to run the program:

You can save the script above in a python file, e.g., myscript.py. Use this command to run the script in a terminal:
```
python myscript.py
```

Specifications and any additional Information:

- `bulk()` : this is a function to generate a bulk crystal of the desired element and crystal structure.
- `"Bi"` : symbol for Bismuth.
- `crystalstructure="rhombohedral"` : the type of crystal structure.
- `a=4.543, c=11.866` : these are the specific lattice parameters for Bismuth in Ångström units.
