Use Case: Use r-formula for statistical modeling tasks where you want to describe relationships between variables. Predominantly used in statistical modeling to create easy to read yet expressive model specification.

Code details and examples:

Code: 

Here is how you would specify a linear regression model with mpg as the response variable and wt and cyl as the explanatory variables in R:

```R
# Load the necessary library
library(stats)

# Load built-in dataset
data(mtcars)

# Specify the model
model <- lm(formula = mpg ~ wt + cyl, data = mtcars)

# Print model summary
print(summary(model))
```

Specification in Input file: Data file (such as a CSV file) where each column is a variable and each row is an observation. Each variable should have a unique name. For the mtcars dataset used in the example above, we have 32 observations on 11 variables, e.g., mpg, cyl, disp, hp, drat, wt, qsec, vs, am, gear, carb.

Sample of Input Data (mtcars data - first five rows):

```
                   mpg cyl disp  hp drat    wt  qsec vs am gear carb

Mazda RX4 Wag     21.0   6  160 110 3.90 2.875 17.02  0  1    4    4
Datsun 710        22.8   4  108  93 3.85 2.320 18.61  1  1    4    1
Hornet 4 Drive    21.4   6  258 110 3.08 3.215 19.44  1  0    3    1
Hornet Sportabout 18.7   8  360 175 3.15 3.620 17.02  0  0    3    2
```

Command to run: In R console or script file just run the lines of code sequentially.

Note that the "~" sign is used to separate the response variables (on the left) from the explanatory variables (on the right). "+" is used to add additional explanatory variables. You can also use "-" to remove variables and ":" to denote interaction terms. Other functions like "I()" can be used for transformations.
