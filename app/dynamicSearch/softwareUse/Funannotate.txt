Use Case: Funannotate is commonly used for predicting and annotating gene models in fungal, plant, and animal genomes. It functions with Unix/Linux and is specifically useful in functional annotation of a genome.

Code Details and Examples: 

Code:

Required Input file Format: genomic DNA sequences in FASTA format and RNA-Seq data if available

```
# Build database
funannotate setup -i all

# Train Augustus
funannotate train -i /path/to/sequences.fasta --species aug_species_model --cpus 16 -o /output/folder

# Predict
funannotate predict -i /path/to/training/sequences.fasta --species aug_species_model -o /output/folder --organism other --SeqCenter 'XYZ' --strain mystrain

# Update
funannotate update -i /output/folder --cpus 16

# Functional annotation
funannotate annotate -i /output/folder --cpus 16
```

Specifications of the input data:
1. Fasta format for sequences
2. Genomic DNA sequences, preferably without any contaminant sequences
3. RNA-seq data to train the algorithm

Command to run:
This is command-line software and all functions are called with "funannotate [function] [options]". Here "[function]" is one of the following: setup, clean, check, species, sort, vectorclean, train, predict, fix, update, annotate, compare, iprscan, remote, p2g, view, test. The "[options]" depend on the function called.
