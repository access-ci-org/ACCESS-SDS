Use Case: Alignment of PacBio Subreads to Polymerase Reads.

Code Details and Examples:

Format required:

Lima requires two input files:

1. Polymerase Read File: This is the primary PacBio read file generated by SMRT sequencing. It is in BAM format (a binary version of SAM format), which includes both subreads and polymerase reads.

2. Barcodes File: This is a FASTA format file which has all the barcode sequences that were used in the sequencing run.

Command to run:

```bash
lima --isoseq --dump-clips --no-pbi subreads.bam barcodes.fasta demultiplexed.bam
```

Specifications and details in input files:

1. Subreads.bam: This file contains subreads, generated by SMRT sequencing. The sequences may be fragmented and can come from both forward and reverse strands of the same DNA template. They are aligned against the polymerase reads to generate a consensus sequence.

2. Barcodes.fasta: This is a simple text file in FASTA format. Each barcode sequence is represented as a separate entry within the file. The ID for each barcode should be unique.

Output files:

1. Demultiplexed.bam files: The output BAM file(s) will be named according to the barcodes and will contain all the reads that match with that barcode.

2. Report.txt file: This is a report file where Lima will display information about how many reads it could classify into each barcode. 

Notice: 

This tool always produces PBI files. If you do not wish to create a PBI file, use the --no-pbi option when calling this tool in the command line.
