Use Case: The Plogr library in R is commonly used for computing the binary logarithm (log base 2). A common use case might be in a bioinformatics context where a dataset of gene expression values often needs to be log-transformed to normalize the data and make it suitable for statistical tests, such as t-tests or ANOVA.

Code details and examples:

Code:

```R
# Load plogr package
library(plogr)

# Define your vector
x <- c(1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64)

# Calculate log base 2 using plogr
result <- plog2(x)

# Print the result
print(result)
```

In this example, the input is a vector of numbers `x`. The output from `plog2(x)` is the binary logarithm of each number in the vector `x`. There are no specific input file formats associated with the plog2 function; however the input should be a numeric vector.

Command to run:

You could run this script from the command line using Rscript, like so:

```bash
Rscript myfile.R
```

Where `myfile.R` is the name of the file that contains the R script above.
