Use Case: Use CoordgenLibs for generating 3D Coordinates from 2D structural diagrams. This is an important tool in drug discovery and material science that uses structure-based drug design.

Code details and examples: Code 

In order to use CoordgenLibs, you will first need to define the molecule object using software that is compatible with CoordgenLibs such as OEChem, RDKit, etc. Below is an example of using CoordgenLibs in concert with RDKit, a PyBiologics library that can produce molecular objects. 

Sample Code: 

```python
from rdkit import Chem
from rdkit.Chem import AllChem
from coordgenlibs import CoordgenMinimizer

# Create a 2D molecule with RDKit
molecule = Chem.MolFromSmiles('C1=CC=C(C=C1)C(=O)O')

# Generate coordinates with CoordgenLibs
minimizer = CoordgenMinimizer()
molecule3D = minimizer.getMinimizedStructureFromMolecule(molecule)

# Convert it back to an RDKit mol object
m = AllChem.AddHs(molecule3D)

# Finally, use RDKit's built-in method to visualize the 3D structure
m.UpdatePropertyCache(strict=False)
AllChem.Compute2DCoords(m)
```
Note that the input file is a SMILES string representing the molecule of interest. SMILES (Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System) is a chemical notation that allows a user to represent a chemical structure in a way that can be used by the computer.

This block of python code produces a 3d molecular structure from a 2D SMILES string by calling the `getMinimizedStructureFromMolecule` method from the `CoordgenMinimizer` object.

To execute the python program, use the python command followed by the filename:

```python filename.py```
