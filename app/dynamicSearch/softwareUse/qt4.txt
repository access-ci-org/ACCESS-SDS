Use Case: Use PyQt4 to develop a simple GUI application that generates a 'Hello, World!' message when a button is clicked.

Code details and examples: Code:

Let's create a simple Python script that imports the required PyQt4 modules, and then create a basic QApplication - the central object of any PyQt4 GUI app - and a QPushButton. 

```python
import sys
from PyQt4.QtGui import QApplication, QPushButton

def greet():
    print("Hello, world!")

app = QApplication(sys.argv)

button = QPushButton("Greet the world!", clicked=greet)
button.show()

app.exec_()
```

In the code above, we first import the necessary modules from PyQt4, then create a QApplication object. We also define a slot - a function that will be called in response to a particular signal - in this case, when the QPushButton is clicked. When the button is clicked, the greet function is executed, and "Hello, world!" is printed to the console.

To run this code, simply run the Python script from your command line:

`python your_script_name.py`
