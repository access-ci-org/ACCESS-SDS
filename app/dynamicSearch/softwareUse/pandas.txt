Use Case: Data manipulation and analysis

Code details and examples:

Code:

The pandas library provides high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools in Python.

This simple example demonstrates using a dataframe in pandas.

```python
# Import pandas library
import pandas as pd

# Create a simple dataframe
data = {'Name': ['Tom', 'Nick', 'John', 'Tom'],
        'Age': [20, 21, 19, 20]}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Display the DataFrame
print(df)

# Output:
#   Name  Age
# 0  Tom   20
# 1  Nick  21
# 2  John  19
# 3  Tom   20
```

The dataframe is the primary data structure in pandas. It is essentially a table, like an Excel spreadsheet.

In this code, we create a dataframe from a Python dictionary, and print it.

For reading a CSV file into a DataFrame we can use the read_csv function.

```python
# Read CSV file into DataFrame
df = pd.read_csv('file.csv')

# Show the first 5 records
print(df.head())

# The output will depend on the CSV file
```

Command to run:

In order to run the above python code snippets:

You would save the python code as a `.py` file and run `python filename.py` in your command line terminal. Of course, this assumes that you have Python installed on your machine and pandas installed in your current Python environment.
