Use Case: The Bio++ libraries are a set of portable, efficient and modular C++ libraries designed for the development of bioinformatics and molecular evolution applications.

Code details and examples:

Bio++ is versatile and does not have one specific input file or format, it heavily depends on the application or custom developed software but we'll use the example of a simple sequence analysis program. 

Input File: An alignment file formatted in PHYLIP. Here's a sample with two sequences that align "AAA-TTT" and "AAA-CCC":

```
2 7
Seq1 AAA-TTT
Seq2 AAA-CCC
```

Code: Here is a simple sequence alignment reading and printing program:

```cpp
#include <Bpp/Seq/Sequence.h>
#include <Bpp/Seq/Alphabet/AlphabetTools.h>
#include <Bpp/Seq/Io/Fasta.h>
#include <Bpp/Seq/Container/VectorSequenceContainer.h>
#include <iostream>

using namespace bpp;

int main()
{
  // Get a sequence reader
  Fasta fastaReader;
  
  // Read a sequence file
  VectorSequenceContainer* sequences = fastaReader.readSequences("/path_to_alignment/aligment.phylip", &AlphabetTools::DNA_ALPHABET);

  // Print the sequences to the console
  for (size_t i = 0; i < sequences->getNumberOfSequences(); ++i) {
    const Sequence* sequence = &sequences->getSequence(i);
    std::cout << sequence->getName() << ": " << sequence->toString() << std::endl;
  }
  
  delete sequences;
  
  return 0;
}
```

Command to compile and run:

```bash
g++ -o sequence_analysis sequence_analysis.cpp -lbpp-seq
./sequence_analysis
```
