Use Case: Using R-Iranges, you can manipulate and analyze integer sets and sequences in R. The IntegerRanges class is a vector representation of a set of integer ranges. It provides a wide range of operations such as creation, comparison, overlap and closest distance between ranges.

Code Details and Examples:

To use R-Iranges, you need data in R-readable format like data frame or tsv file. Let's consider we have a data frame with start and end positions of genomic regions.

```R
# Sample Input
data <- data.frame(
    start = c(1, 10, 20),
    end = c(5, 15, 40)
)
```

Now, import IRanges library and create an Interval tree from start and end positions.

```R
# Import Library
library(IRanges)

# Create IRanges object
ranges <- IRanges(start = data$start, end = data$end)

print(ranges)
```

The output will be something like this:

```R
IRanges object with 3 ranges and 0 metadata columns:
          start       end     width
      [1]     1         5         5
      [2]     10       15         6
      [3]     20       40        21
```

You can perform operations like width, distance and overlap with other ranges.

```R
# Width of ranges
width(ranges)

# Distance between ranges
distance(ranges)

# Overlap with other ranges
overlapWidth(ranges, IRanges(start = c(30), end = c(50)))
```

The command to run the R script can be:

```bash
Rscript script.R
```
