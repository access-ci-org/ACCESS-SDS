Use Case: Use fiona package to read geometrical objects and their associated attributes from a shapefile.

Code details and examples: Code 

Here is an example of how to read from a shapefile and write to a GeoJSON file using Fiona:

```
import fiona
from fiona.crs import from_epsg

# Input file
in_file_path = "path/to/your/input.shp"

# Open the input file
src = fiona.open(in_file_path)

# Output file
out_file_path = "path/to/your/output.json"

# Create a sink for processed features with the same format and
# coordinate reference system as the source.
sink_schema = src.schema.copy()
sink_crs = from_epsg(4326)

with fiona.open(
        out_file_path, 'w',
        crs=sink_crs,
        driver="GeoJSON",
        schema=sink_schema
    ) as sink:

    # Process each feature
    for f in src:
        try:
            sink.write(f)
        except Exception as e:
            # Writing failed, likely because the geometry is invalid.
            print("Failed to write feature {} to output. {}".format(f['id'], e))

Command to run the Fiona Python code:
```bash
python your_python_file.py
```
In the above code, your_python_file.py is the python script where you have written your code. Replace 'your_python_file' with your actual python filename.

Note: This example assumes you have fiona installed in your python environment and shapefile and json file in the correct directory. The `.shp` file and `.json` file path in the code should be replaced with the actual file path of your input and output file. Also, the EPSG:4326 represents WGS84 coordinate system, but you can replace this with the EPSG code that matches your data's coordinate system.
