Use Case: r-xml2 is used for parsing and manipulating XML within R and it supports both reading XML files into R structures, and creating R structures which can then be written into XML strings or files.

Code details and examples:

Code:

```r
library(xml2)

# To read XML data from a URL or a file
xml <- read_xml("http://www.w3schools.com/xml/note.xml")

# To find all of the nodes that have a certain name. Returns a list of XML nodes
xml_find_all(xml, "to")

# To find the first node that has a certain name. Returns a single XML node
xml_find_first(xml, "//title")

# To get or set the name of a node
xml_name(xml)

# Get the text of a node
xml_text(xml)

# To convert an XML document to a character vector
as.character(xml)

# To write an xml document to a file
write_xml(xml, "file.xml")
```

Input file format and requirements:

The input file would be an XML document and must be a text file in XML format compliant with XML syntax rules.

Command to run:

This file can be run in an R environment. For an R script file named `script.R` you would use:

```shell
Rscript script.R
```
