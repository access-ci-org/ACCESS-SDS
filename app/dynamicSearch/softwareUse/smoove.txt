Use Case: Smoove is a set of tools for calling and genotyping structural variants (SVs) from next-generation sequencing data, particularly for whole genome sequencing. It has specially designed features for reducing false positives and for easy interpretation of SV calling results.

Code details and examples:

Code:

This is just an example of how to call SVs using smoove with one 30x coverage human whole genome sequencing (WGS) sample:

```bash
smoove call \
    --outdir results \
    --name sample-name \
    --fasta reference-genome.fa \
    --processes 24 \
    --genotype \
    sample.bam
```

Here, the input files are:

1. `sample.bam`: a BAM-formatted file of aligned sequencing reads. This should come from a WGS experiment, and it supports only one input BAM file at a time. The BAM file must be sorted and indexed (`samtools index` can do this).

2. `reference-genome.fa`: FASTA-formatted file of the reference genome. It must be indexed with samtools faidx and bwa index.

The output is a VCF file in the specified directory ("results" in this case) containing the called and genotyped structural variants.
