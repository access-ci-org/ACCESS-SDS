Use Case: Perl is a high-level, general-purpose and interpreted scripting language. It is useful in a variety of tasks such as system administration, web development, network programming, GUI development, etc.

Code Details and Examples:

Code:
```
#!/usr/bin/perl

# Here is a simple perl script to print "Hello World"
print "Hello, World!\n";
```

Input files are not required specifically for Perl scripts. However, file handling can be done in Perl like in any other language. 
Below is a simple example of reading from a text file named 'sample.txt' in Perl:

```
#!/usr/bin/perl

# Open the file in read-only mode
open(DATA, "<sample.txt") or die "Couldn't open file file.txt, $!";

# Read the file line by line
while(<DATA>){
   print "$_";
}

# Close the file
close(DATA)
```
The command to run the Perl script:
```
perl script.pl
```
This command will execute the script named 'script.pl'. Make sure the script has execute permission.
