Use Case: Use SeqyClean to quality control and preprocess NGS sequencing data. SeqyClean is typically used to remove technical sequences (adaptors, primers etc.), low quality reads, reads with N bases, and contaminant sequences (in that order).
 
Code details and examples:

Code: 
```
./seqyclean -1 sample_R1.fastq -2 sample_R2.fastq -s contaminants.fasta -o output_folder
```

Input File Format: FASTQ format for the sequencing reads (reads for QC)
Specification and detail in Input file:
For the `-1` and `-2` arguments, these are the sequencing reads from an experiment, each in FASTQ format. 

For `-s`, SeqyClean expects a contaminant sequence file in FASTA format. 

Input file example:
```
@SEQ_ID
GATTTGGGGTTCAAAGCAGTATCGATCAAATAGTAAATCCATTTGTTCAACTCACAGTTT
+
!''*((((***+))%%%++)(%%%%).1***-+*''))**55CCF>>>>>>CCCCCCC65
```
Above is an example of a FASTQ record which includes a sequence ID, the raw sequence, a '+' and a quality score line.
