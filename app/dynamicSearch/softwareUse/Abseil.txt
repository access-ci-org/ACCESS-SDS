Use Case: Abseil is a collection of C++ code (compliant to C++11) designed to augment the C++ standard library. Google itself uses Abseil for its production systems. It treats additions as an extension of the standard library, like `std::string` replacements, container types, threading, and synchronization primitives, etc.

Code details and examples:

Code:

```cpp
#include "absl/strings/str_join.h"
#include "absl/strings/str_split.h"
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

int main() {
   std::vector<std::string> v = {"foo","bar","baz"};
   std::string s = absl::StrJoin(v, "-");

   std::cout << s << std::endl;     // "foo-bar-baz"

   std::vector<std::string> v2 = absl::StrSplit(s, '-');
   for (const auto& x : v2) {
       std::cout << x << std::endl;  // "foo" "bar" "baz"
   }
   return 0;
}
```

Input file format: Not applicable as Abseil is a library to be used in C++ code, not a standalone software. 

Specifications in input file: Not applicable.

Command to run: Once written, C++ code can be compiled using g++ or any C++ compiler and then run the executable.

```shell
# to compile the code
$ g++ -std=c++11 -I /path/to/abseil your_code.cpp -o your_program

# to run the code
$ ./your_program
```
