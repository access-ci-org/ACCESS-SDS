Use Case: HELEN is a deep learning based error correction and consensus module to refine noisy predictions of tools like MarginPolish. This functionality is essential in scientific and research fields that require a high fidelity output from their data sets, particularly in bioinformatics and the like, be it reading a genome for further investigation, sequence alignment, or making predictions about potential genetic conditions.

Code details and examples:

Code: 
```
# This command applies HELEN's error correction using your input model and saving the output to a file of your choice.
helen polish --image_dir images.hdf --model_path model.pkl --num_workers 10 --output_dir output
```
Input Specifications:

"images.hdf" is the HDF file created by MarginPolish, which contains the draft base calls, per base features, and true labels for a specific task.

"model.pkl" is the model that has been trained to predict from the MarginPolish HDF files.

"output" is the directory/output file where the polished assembly will be written.

The output directory must not exist before running the command and will be created by HELEN. 

Remember to replace "images.hdf", "model.pkl" and "output" with the actual paths to your input files and desired output directory/file.
