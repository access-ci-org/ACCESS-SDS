Use Case: ViennaRNA is a software package that provides an option to predict secondary structures of single stranded RNA or DNA sequences. It also offers comparative sequence analysis options.

Code details and examples: Code

To use ViennaRNA, the input file should be in FASTA format. Hereâ€™s an example of a sequence in a FASTA format:

```
>SequenceName
GCUAUCUGCAUAGCUAGCUAGC
```

The secondary structure prediction can be initiated with the 'RNAfold' command:

```sh
RNAfold < input.fasta
```

The output is the sequence, structure, and the free energy like this:

```sh
>SequenceName
GCUAUCUGCAUAGCUAGCUAGC
.....((((..((((..)))).)))). (-12.30)
```

Note: The brackets denote base pairs while the '.' signifies unpaired bases. The number in the bracket is the minimum free energy (MFE) in kcal/mol. 

For comparative sequence analysis, the tool `RNAalifold` can be used. The input file should contain the aligned sequences in ClustalW format. 

```sh
RNAalifold < aligned_sequences.clustalw
```

The result is similar to RNAfold's output, but with an additional line for consensus structure. 

Remember, ViennaRNA package has many tools associated with it. The functionality depends upon the exact tool that you are using from the package.
