Use Case: Use kraken2 for metagenomic sequence classification using exact k-mer matches. 

Code details and examples: 

For kraken2, the input file format would typically be a standard FASTA sequence file or a FASTQ file. 

Here's a sample format of a FASTA file:

```shell
>sequence_1
GATTACA
>sequence_2
TAGACAT
```

And FASTQ:

```shell
@sequence_1
GATTACA
+
!!!
@sequence_2
TAGACAT
+
!!!
```

Once you have your input file(s), you can run kraken2 with a command like this:

```shell
kraken2 --db database_name input_file > output_file
```

In this command, 'database_name' refers to the name of the database you created or downloaded for kraken2 to use. 'input_file' is your sequence file and 'output_file' is where kraken2 will write its results.

Let's say you have a database called 'mini_kraken2_v1' and an input file called 'test.fasta', with the output going to a file called 'results.txt'. The command would look like this:

```shell
kraken2 --db mini_kraken2_v1 test.fasta > results.txt
```

This would search all sequences in 'test.fasta' and write the results to 'results.txt'. Every sequence in the input file will get a line in the output file, with the sequence ID followed by the taxonomy ID of the species most closely matching that sequence.
