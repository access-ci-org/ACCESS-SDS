Use Case: GLEW (OpenGL Extension Wrangler Library) is a cross-platform open-source C/C++ extension loading library. GLEW provides efficient run-time mechanisms for determining which OpenGL extensions are supported on the target platform. OpenGL developers use this tool to access OpenGL capabilities beyond the regular API.

Code Details and Examples:

Code:

```C
#include <GL/glew.h>
#include <GLFW/glfw3.h>

int main(void)
{
    GLFWwindow* window;

    /* Initialize the library */
    if (!glfwInit())
        return -1;

    /* Create a windowed mode window and its OpenGL context */
    window = glfwCreateWindow(640, 480, "Hello World", NULL, NULL);
    if (!window)
    {
        glfwTerminate();
        return -1;
    }

    /* Make the window's context current */
    glfwMakeContextCurrent(window);

    /* Loop until the user closes the window */
    while (!glfwWindowShouldClose(window))
    {
        /* Render here */
        glClear(GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT);

        // Draw a triangle
        glBegin(GL_TRIANGLES);
        glVertex2f(-0.5f, -0.5f);
        glVertex2f(0.0f, 0.5f);
        glVertex2f(0.5f, -0.5f);
        glEnd();

        /* Swap front and back buffers */
        glfwSwapBuffers(window);

        /* Poll for and process events */
        glfwPollEvents();
    }

    glfwTerminate();
    return 0;
}
```

Note: This is a simple application that creates a window and renders a triangle using OpenGL. GLEW must be correctly installed and linked to the project.

Command to compile and run (Linux/Unix):

```bash
gcc -lGLEW -lglfw example.c -o example
./example
```

Note: This command assumes GLEW and GLFW are installed in the system. The `-lGLEW -lglfw` flags tell the linker to link against these libraries. The `gcc` command compiles the C file, `example.c`, and produces an output executable called `example`. The `./example` command runs the produced executable.
