Use Case: RepeatModeler is a de novo repeat family identification and modeling package. It can build, refine and classify consensus models of putative interspersed repeats from de novo sequence assemblies or WGS datasets. 

Code details and examples: Code

```
BuildDatabase -name <database_name> -engine <seq_search_method> <genome_sequence_file>
```

The genome_sequence_file should be in FASTA format. For example,

```
>sequence_1
ATCGATCGATCGATCGATCGAT
>sequence_2
ACGTACGTACGTACGTACGTAC
```

To run RepeatModeler:

```
RepeatModeler -database <database_name> -engine <seq_search_method> -pa <parallel_jobs>
```

Example:

```
BuildDatabase -name my_database -engine ncbi my_genome.fasta
RepeatModeler -database my_database -engine ncbi -pa 10
``` 

In this case, `<database_name>` would be replaced by your desired name for the database, `<seq_search_method>` should be replaced with the sequence search method you wish to use (e.g. "ncbi" or "rmblast"), `<genome_sequence_file>` should be replaced with the path to your input genome sequence file in FASTA format, and `<parallel_jobs>` should be replaced with the number of jobs you want to run in parallel. For the example given, a database named "my_database" is created using NCBI's sequence search method and the input genome sequence file "my_genome.fasta", and 10 jobs are specified to run in parallel.
