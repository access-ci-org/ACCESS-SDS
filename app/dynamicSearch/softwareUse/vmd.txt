Use Case: VMD (Visual Molecular Dynamics) is a molecular visualization and analysis software designed to simulate and analyze large biomolecular systems. 

Code details and examples: Code

1. Visualization of a PDB file

Input file: A PDB (Protein Data Bank) file containing 3D coordinates of atoms in a molecule/protein. 

Sample Input File (XYZ format):

```
6
Water
O  0.000000 0.000000 0.000000
H  0.757000 0.586000 0.000000
H -0.757000 0.586000 0.000000
```

Command to run:

```vmd -pdb input.pdb```

2. Use tcl script for automated analysis

Input file: A Tcl script file to automate VMD's functionalities.

Sample Tcl script file

```
# Load a PDB file
mol load pdb "input.pdb"

# simple Analysis, calculate number of hydrogen bonds
set sel [atomselect top "name O or name N"]
$sel hbonds -sel $sel -dist 3.0 -angle 20.0 -plot "hbonds.dat"
```

Command to run:

```vmd -dispdev text -e script.tcl```
