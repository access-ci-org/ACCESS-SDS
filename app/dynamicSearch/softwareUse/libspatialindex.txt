Use Case: libspatialindex is a library that provides a general framework for managing spatial indices. It's useful for applications that perform point location queries, nearest neighbor searches, and range searching.

Code details and examples:

Code: 

In the using libspatialindex, you would typically begin by creating an instance of `SpatialIndex::ISpatialIndex`, then use the `SpatialIndex::ISpatialIndex::insertData` method to add spatially indexed data. Here's an example of how you to use it:

```cpp
#include <spatialindex/SpatialIndex.h>
#include <iostream>

using namespace SpatialIndex;
using namespace std;

// define the dimensionality of the data which is to be held within the tree.
// in this example, a 2D point would be held.
double coords[2] = {1.00, 1.50}; 
Point p = Point(&coords[0], 2); 
```

The details in the input file include coordinates. The point `1.00, 1.50` is being stored in the `Point p` object. Check specifics of any software as different softwares have different details required. 

To run this code, it can be compiled using a C++ compiler like g++. 

```bash
> g++ -o output filename.cpp
```

Then, you can run the output file

```bash
> ./output
```
