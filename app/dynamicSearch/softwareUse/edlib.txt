Use Case: Edlib is a C/C++ library for sequence alignment using edit distance. It's commonly used in bioinformatics for comparing two biological sequences, finding similarity or assessing how different they are.

Code details and examples:

Code:

The library comes with a command-line tool for simple sequence alignment. To align two sequences, you could use the following command in your terminal:

```bash
edlib-aligner sequence1.fasta sequence2.fasta
```

Where `sequence1.fasta` and `sequence2.fasta` are your input files in FASTA format. These files contain the sequences to be aligned. For example, a FASTA file may look like this:

```
>sequence1
ATCGATCGATCGATCGATCGATCGATCGATCG
```

The greater-than symbol (`>`) indicates the start of a new sequence record, following by the sequence identity (sequence1 in this case). The next lines show the nucleotide sequence.

In this case, no specific format or additional specifications are required for the input file, except that it must be in FASTA format. 

To run the code, simple input this command on your terminal to compare sequences and get the alignment:

```bash
edlib-aligner sequence1.fasta sequence2.fasta
``` 

Please note that the `edlib-aligner` is a separate command line application that uses the `edlib` library and needs to be installed separately.
