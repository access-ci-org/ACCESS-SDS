Use Case: Bumphunter is a Bioconductor software package used for finding differentially methylated regions (DMRs) in methylation data. It's used in epigenomic studies where there is a need to identify genomic regions that show different methylation patterns across different conditions.

Code details and examples:

Code: 

To use Bumphunter, you usually start by loading the necessary packages and setting the right options for the analysis. An example is shown below:

```
library(Biobase)
library(bumphunter)
options(stringsAsFactors=FALSE)

```

Then, you would need to load the data. The input to Bumphunter is usually a data frame or matrix containing the methylation data. Each row represents a genomic feature, e.g., a CpG site, and each column represents a sample. Below is an example:

```
methy_data <- read.csv("methylation_data.csv")
```

Then, you define your design matrix. The design matrix indicates the experimental conditions for each sample in the methylation data. 

```
design_matrix <- model.matrix(~ condition, data = pdata)
```

Finally, you run Bumphunter. This might look like the following:

```
res <- bumphunter(methy_data, design = design_matrix, cutoff = 0.1)
```

In the code above, `bumphunter` is the main function in the package that does the DMR analysis. The `methy_data` is the input data, `design` is the design matrix, and `cutoff` is a parameter that controls the threshold for calling DMRs.

In the end, `res` will be a table of DMRs, each row represents one DMR, including the genomic coordinates, the mean methylation difference, the statistical significance, etc.

No command is needed to run this package in R, you just need to use the R interpreter to run the R script that contains these commands.
