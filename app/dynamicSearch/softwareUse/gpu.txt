Use Case: Running an AI model training session using Tensorflow that requires high-level GPU computation power for processing large volumes of data. 

Code details and examples:
Code:
```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Create some tensors
a = tf.constant([[1.0, 2.0, 3.0], [4.0, 5.0, 6.0]])
b = tf.constant([[1.0, 2.0], [3.0, 4.0], [5.0, 6.0]])

c = tf.matmul(a, b)

print("c:", c)

# Check if GPU is available
print("Is the Tensor on GPU #0:  "),
print(c.device.endswith('GPU:0'))
```
- The code uses Tensorflow library to perform Matrix Multiplication.
- Checks if the operation was performed using GPU.

Required Input Format: There is no input file required for this code but a compatible GPU device should be available. 

Command to run the Code: `python3 filename.py` where filename.py is your python file. 

Specifications and Details in Input Files: The code doesn't have input files, instead it creates some tensors. 

NOTE: Make sure your system has a compatible GPU and correctly installed Tensorflow.
