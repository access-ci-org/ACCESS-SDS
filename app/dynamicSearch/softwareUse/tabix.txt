Use Case: Tabix is a generic indexer that allows fast retrieval of very large tab-delimited, newline-terminated text files with a header; it's a great tool for querying and managing large genetic variation datasets.

Code details and examples: Code.

Tabix requires a sorted and compressed input file:

Sample input file (named 'file.txt'):

```
1 1000 rs1 0 0
2 2000 rs2 0 0
3 3000 rs3 0 0
4 4000 rs4 0 0
5 5000 rs5 0 0
```

To sort and compress:

```
sort -k1,1 -k2,2n file.txt | bgzip > file.gz
```
The -k options indicate the key fields; here, the sort is on fields 1 and 2 (chromosome and position). The 'n' following the 2 in -k2,2n directs a numerical sort.

Then, index the compressed file:

```
tabix -s 1 -b 2 -e 2 file.gz
```
The -s, -b, and -e options indicate the columns for the chromosome, start position, and end position, respectively.

To query the resulting index:

```
tabix file.gz 1:1000-2000
```
Retrieving variants on chromosome 1 between positions 1000 and 2000.
