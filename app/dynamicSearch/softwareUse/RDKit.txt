Use Case: RDKit is a collection of cheminformatics and machine learning tools. It includes functionality for drawing 2D and 3D molecules, generating 3D conformations, clustering, descriptor calculation, and more. It is also a base tool for many bioinformatic and cheminformatic software.

Code Details and Examples: 

Input: The input to RDKit is usually a molecule file in a format such as .sdf or .mol. Other formats including SMILES strings can also be used.

Example Input File: A SMILES string representing a molecule
       
              CC(=O)OC1=CC=CC=C1C(=O)O     

Code: Below is a simple code snippet to read the SMILES string input and generate a 2D depiction of the molecule

```python
from rdkit import Chem
from rdkit.Chem import Draw

# Create a molecule object from a SMILES string
mol = Chem.MolFromSmiles('CC(=O)OC1=CC=CC=C1C(=O)O')

# Generate a depiction of the molecule
img = Draw.MolToImage(mol)

# Display the image
img.show()
```
This code takes a SMILES string as input, creates a molecule object, then generates and shows a 2D depiction of the molecule.

Command to Run:

This code can be run in a Python environment. If the code is saved in a file named script.py, it can be run with the command:

```shell
python script.py
```
