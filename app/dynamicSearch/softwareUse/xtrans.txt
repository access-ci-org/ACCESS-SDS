Use Case: Xtrans is an interface layer between an X server and the underlying operating system to provide network protocol, I/O, and OS integration. It can be used in various environments where X Window System is functioning. It offers services such as opening, closing, reading, and writing to connections. 

Code Details and Examples: Code

The Xtrans library usually doesn't require direct interaction by users or user-defined programs, but instead acts as part of the infrastructure for X server and client interactions. Here is a simple snippet which demonstrates how Xtrans might be applied internally by X server or client code:

```C
#include <X11/Xtrans/Xtrans.h>

...

/* This code assumes variables `servername`, `protocol`, and `family` have 
   been defined and filled with appropriate values. */
   
/* Make a connection to the X server. */
int index = _XirisTransportIndex(servername, protocol, family);
if (index < 0) {
    printf("Failed to get transport index.\n");
    return -1;
}
    
XtransConnInfo conn_info = _XirisOpenCOTSClient(index, protocol, servername);
if (conn_info == NULL) {
    printf("Failed to open connection.\n");
    return -1;
}
    
/* Now the connection is open and can be used. When done, close it. */
_XirisCloseConn(conn_info);
```
The above code first obtains the index of a specified transport method (using `servername`, `protocol`, and `family` as arguments) with `_XirisTransportIndex()`. This index is then used to open a connection-oriented transport service (COTS) client to an X server with `_XirisOpenCOTSClient()`. Once the connection is opened, it can be used to transfer data. Then, when the connection is no longer required, it is closed using `_XirisCloseConn()`.

There is no specific input file for this kind of setup as the parameters are usually defined and used within code. 

Run command:
The command to run C programs depends on the compiler you are using. For the GNU Compiler Collection (gcc), you would use the following command:

``` bash
gcc program.c -o program -L/path/to/X11/Xtrans -lXtrans
./program
```

This command assumes that `program.c` is the filename of your C source file. The `-L` option tells the compiler where the Xtrans library is located, and `-lXtrans` links against the Xtrans library. The `-o` option specifies the output filename. Finally, `./program` runs the compiled program.
