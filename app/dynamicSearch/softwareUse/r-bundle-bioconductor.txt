Use Case: Bioconductor is an open-source software project for the analysis and comprehension of high-throughput genomics data. It's ingrained in R, an open-source statistical programming language. Here, we predict the expression level on a particular set of genes.

Code details and examples:

Code:

It starts by loading the required library.

```R
library(Biobase)
```

Suppose you have a matrix of gene expression data, with one row for each gene and one column for each sample

```R
data <- read.table("gene_expression_data.txt", header=TRUE, row.names=1)
```
The format of "gene_expression_data.txt" should be a tab-delimited file, with genes in rows and samples in columns. The first row and first column should be headers.

```R
      Sample1 Sample2 Sample3
Gene1      3     4.2     3.7
Gene2    7.1     6.9     7.2
Gene3    0.2     0.4     0.1
```

You can use the exprs() function from Biobase to compute the mean expression level for each gene across all samples

```R
mean_expression_levels <- rowMeans(exprs(data))
```
The command to run this example will depend on your R setup. Most commonly:

```R
Rscript gene_expression_mean.R
```
