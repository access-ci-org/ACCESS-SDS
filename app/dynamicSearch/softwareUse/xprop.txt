Use Case: xprop is a tool that allows users to examine and edit window and font properties in an X server. A common use case would be to get the window id of a specific window on an X server.

Code details and examples: 

Code: 
```
xprop -id $(xprop -root -notype | awk '$1=="_NET_ACTIVE_WINDOW(WINDOW):" {print $5}')
```
This command uses awk to parse the id of the active window from the output of a `xprop -root -notype` command and then it passes it to another `xprop` command to extract the properties of it. 

Sample Input File: No Input File is required in this case. 

Input Format Requirements: The above command can take any type of input provided. 

Additional Specifications: You need to use ";" to separate xprop flags. The "-id" option specifies the window to examine when you do not click a window. 

Command to Run: `xprop` or `xprop -root`
