Use Case: Use mash for fast genome and metagenome distance estimation using MinHash. It is particularly useful for large datasets as sizes and sequencing depth are reduced to fixed-length signatures.

Code Details and Examples: Code

Sample Input File:
A FASTA or FASTQ file is used as input for mash. The input file can be uncompressed or compressed with gzip.

Format Required:
FASTA/FASTQ format which includes nucleotide sequences. Example of a FASTA file:

```
>Sequence1
ATCGGGAGGCGTGA
>Sequence2
TGCCTTAGCTAGGCCC
```

Specifications and details in input files:
Each sequence in the FASTA/FASTQ file must have a unique identifier, followed by the nucleotide sequence. If the input is a multi-FASTA file, each sequence is treated separately. It's important that the given sequence identifiers should not contain white spaces.

Code Snippet (using Sketch to create a .msh sketch from a FASTA file):

```
mash sketch -i input.fasta -o output.msh
```

Command to run:

```
mash dist output.msh another.fasta > output.dist
```

This will create a .dist file with row-wise output for each 'query' input (species compared against the .msh sketch in this case). 

Note: 'input.fasta' and 'another.fasta' are placeholders for your sequence data.

Command line flags `-i` and `-o` specify the input and output files respectively. The 'dist' command creates an output with distance estimation between the .msh sketch and another .fasta file.
