Use Case: Clairvoyante is a tool used for predicting variant types, indels, zygosity, etc., from genomic sequences using deep learning models. It requires as inputs, two files: a tensorflow model file (trained for the particular task) and a genomic data file (in .npz format).

Code Details and Examples:
Code snippet to run Clairvoyante (assuming the model file is named 'model' and the input file is named 'input.npz'):

```python
import Clairvoyante.model as model
import Clairvoyante.call_variants as call_variants
m = model.Model('model')
call_variants.call(m, 'input.npz')
```

The model file is a binary file storing the weights and architecture of a tensorflow deep learning model. It doesn't have a particular format, but is generated through training the model on the command line with the training data set. 

The input file is a .npz file storing the sequences and their variants in a compressed numpy array format. Its format depends on the task, but generally it stores one sequence per line, with the sequence and its variants separated by tabs. For example:

```
AACTG  0 0 0 1
TTGAC  1 0 0 0
CTGAT  0 1 0 0
```
This represents three sequences: 'AACTG', 'TTGAC', and 'CTGAT'. The numbers after the sequences represent the variants, with 1 indicating the presence of the variant and 0 indicating its absence. 

The command to run the python script varies depending on the environment, but generally you can use:

```bash
python script.py
```
Where 'script.py' is the python script that uses Clairvoyante to call variants.
