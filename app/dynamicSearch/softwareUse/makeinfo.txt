For converting a Texinfo source file to the Info format, the input should be a .texi file. 

Sample Input File: sample.texi 

Content of sample.texi:
@setfilename sample.info 
@settitle Sample Document 
This is a sample document.

Command to run:

makeinfo sample.texi 

This will generate an Info file named sample.info from the sample.texi source file.

For the HTML format, the command would be:

makeinfo --html sample.texi

This will produce sample.html as output. Similarly, for the PDF format, the command would be:

texi2pdf sample.texi 

This will produce sample.pdf as output file. Make sure the document is written in correct Texinfo format, otherwise errors may occur during the conversion. It's recommended to read the Texinfo manual for getting familiar with the Texinfo language.
