Use Case: Magics is the ECMWF's software for meteorological visualization. It assists in creating meteorological data visualizations like contours, wind fields or symbols over maps.

Code Details and Examples: 

To use Magics, you need to have specific input data in the form of meteorological GRIB or NetCDF files or the BUFR format for observations.

Sample GRIB file (only a representation due to the binary format):

```
GRIB1|0|24|T|2|200|10|180|10|0|0
```

Here's how to use sample python code to generate a meteorological contour plot using Magics:

```python
import Magics.macro as magics

#defining the projection
projection = magics.mmap(
    subpage_map_library_area = "on",
    subpage_map_area_name = "europe",
    page_id_line = "off"
)

#Loading GRIB file
temperature = magics.mgrib(grib_input_file_name = 'sample.grib')

#Defining the contour
contour = magics.mcont(
    contour_level_selection_type = 'interval',
    contour_interval = 2.00,
    contour_shade = 'on',
    contour_shade_method = 'area_fill',
    contour_label = 'off'
)

#Defining the coastlines
coastlines = magics.mcoast()

#Plotting
magics.plot(projection, temperature, contour, coastlines)

```

To Run command: Typically, python files can be run using the command `python filename.py`. For the given python script saved as `sample.py`, the run command would be:

```bash
python sample.py
