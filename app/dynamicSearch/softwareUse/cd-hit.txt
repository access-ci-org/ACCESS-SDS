Use Case: CD-HIT is a very widely used bioinformatics software for clustering and comparing large sets of protein or nucleotide sequences. CD-HIT is often used to build non-redundant sequence databases or to identify and remove redundant sequences.

Code details and examples:

Code:

First, you will require an input file in FASTA format. FASTA is a text-based format for representing nucleotide or peptide sequences, using single-letter codes. A sample file could look like this:

>seq0
ATGGCGAACCCT
>seq1
ATGGCGAACCCT

Let's call this file "input.fasta".

Now, to run cd-hit and generate clusters of similar sequences, you could use:

```
cd-hit -i input.fasta -o output.fasta -c 0.9 -n 5
```

Here -i denotes the input file, -o is the output file, -c is the sequence identity threshold (0.9 means 90% similarity), -n is the word length (a good value could be 5 for proteins or 10 for DNAs). Output files will contain the representative sequences of each newly created cluster.

Note, when files are huge it might be required to increase otherwise limited memory usage. This can be done through a specific parameter:

```
cd-hit -i input.fasta -o output.fasta -c 0.9 -n 5 -M 0
```

In this case, -M 0 means that there is no memory limit, and all available memory can be used. You should use this flag wisely, and always in accordance with your available resources.
