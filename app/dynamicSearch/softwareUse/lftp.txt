2. Transfer file from server to local machine
```

```
This command retrieves "file_name" from the server.

3. Transfer directory from server to local machine
```

```
This command copies the entire directory named "directory_name" from server.

4. Upload file or directory to server 
```

```
This command uploads "file_name" to your current directory on the server. For directories use `mirror -R directory_name`.
