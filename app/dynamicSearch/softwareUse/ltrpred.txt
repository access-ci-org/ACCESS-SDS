Use Case: LTRpred is an integrated computational pipeline that allows for the de novo prediction, annotation, and visualization of full-length Long Terminal Repeat (LTR) retrotransposons in genome sequences.

Code details and examples: Code.

Input file: You'll need a genome sequence in FASTA format.

File format: The input file must be in FASTA format (*.fasta or *.fa)

Command to run:
```bash
LTRpred(genome.file = "path/to/your/genome.fasta")  
```

Code Snippets:

```R
# Load the required library
library(LTRpred)

# Set the path to the genome file
genome.file <- system.file("extdata", "genome.fasta", package = "LTRpred")

# Run LTRpred
LTRpred(genome.file = genome.file)
```

This script loads the LTRpred library, sets the path to the genome file, and then runs the LTRpred function to predict and annotate LTR retrotransposons.

Specification and Details in Input files: 

1. The input genome file must be in FASTA format and the sequences must be correctly formatted (no non-standard characters or blank spaces).
2. If the genome file is large, the computation may take a long time or exceed available memory. It is recommended to divide large genome files into smaller ones. 

Note: LTRpred uses several other software tools as part of its pipeline, which need to be correctly installed and configured. It also requires a working internet connection for some parts of the computation. You might need to adjust some parameters depending on the specific genome and your requirements (e.g., the taxonomic group, the minimum and maximum length of the predicted LTR retrotransposons, etc.). Please refer to the LTRpred manual for more information.
