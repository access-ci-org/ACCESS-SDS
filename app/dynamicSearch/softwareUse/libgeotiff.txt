Use Case: libgeotiff is used often used in Geographic Information Systems (GIS) applications for manipulating GeoTIFF data. GeoTIFFs are essentially TIFF files embedded with geographic metadata.

Code details and examples:

The sample input file required for this library would be a TIFF file with geographic metadata (GeoTIFF). The format for GeoTIFF includes, but is not limited to: geographic coordinates, datums, map projections, etc.

An example of how to use the libgeotiff library in a C program:

Code:
```c
#include "geotiff.h"
#include "geo_normalize.h"

int main()
{
    GeoTIFFDirectory *dir;
    GTIF *gtif;
    TIFF *tif;
    // open TIF file
    tif = XTIFFOpen("sample.tif", "r");
    if (tif) {
        // create GeoTIFF structure
        gtif = GTIFNew(tif);
        if (gtif) {
            // print all key-value pairs
            GTIFPrint(gtif, 0, 0);
            // cleanup
            GTIFFree(gtif);
        }
        XTIFFClose(tif);
    }
    return 0;
}
```
This code simply opens a sample GeoTIFF file `sample.tif`, creates a GeoTIFF structure from it, prints all key-value pairs in the metadata, and then cleans up its resources.

Command to run for the code written in a `main.c`:

```sh
gcc -o main main.c -lgeotiff
./main
```
