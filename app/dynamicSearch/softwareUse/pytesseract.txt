Use Case: PyTesseract is a python library that makes use of Tesseract's OCR (Optical Character Recognition) capabilities to convert the text in images into a string form. This can be used in a variety of applications including Image to Text conversion, Data mining and extraction, and many others.

Code details and examples:

Code Example 1: Basic usage of PyTesseract

```python
from PIL import Image
import pytesseract

# Open an image file
img = Image.open('test_image.png')

# Use pytesseract to convert the image into text
text = pytesseract.image_to_string(img)

# Print the result
print(text)
```
The input file here is an image file ('test_image.png') with readable text in it. PyTesseract works best with clear, high-resolution images.

Command to run it (on a console):
```bash
python filename.py
```
where filename.py should be replaced with the name of the Python script that contains the above code.

Code Example 2: Using a different language with PyTesseract

```python
from PIL import Image
import pytesseract

# Open an image file
img = Image.open('test_image.png')

# Use pytesseract to convert the image into text
# Using French as the language
text = pytesseract.image_to_string(img, lang='fra')

# Print the result
print(text)
```
The input is the same as the previous example, but now we're specifying the 'lang' parameter as 'fra' (French). PyTesseract and Tesseract itself support a wide variety of languages, which can be specified using the 'lang' parameter.

Command to run it (on a console):
```bash
python filename.py
```
where filename.py should be replaced with the name of the Python script that contains the above code.
