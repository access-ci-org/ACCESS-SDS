Use Case: Gaussian Processes Regression is implemented using GPy, a Gaussian Process (GP) framework written in Python, offering a choice of likelihood constructs and inference techniques. The library is typically used in sophisticated machine learning models, for example in the analysis of biological data, forecasting, and other areas that require the capturing of complex patterns.

Code details and examples: Code

The GPy library must first be imported. You may need to load numpy as well.

```
import GPy
import numpy as np
```

The data you want to analyze must be provided as input in the form of matrices. As such, numpy is used for creating matrices in the necessary format. Here's an example:

Input Files:

```python
# creating input and output data
X_input = np.array([[1.,3.], [2., 4.],[3., 5.]])
Y_output = np.array([[2.],[4.],[6.]])
```

The Gaussian Processes Regression model can then be defined and fitted to your data:

```python
kernel = GPy.kern.RBF(input_dim=2, variance=1., lengthscale=1.)
model = GPy.models.GPRegression(X_input,Y_output,kernel)
```

The code above sets up an RBF kernel and a GP Regression model with that kernel. The kernel parameters, like input dimensions, variance, and lengthscale, can be adjusted as necessary.

The model can then be optimized. This is generally done via gradient descent, maximizing the likelihood of the observed data. Here is a sample code:

```python
model.optimize(messages=True)
```

The example above shows how to fit a Gaussian Processes Regression model to your data using GPy, which involves defining a kernel and a model with that kernel, fitting the model to your data, and optimizing it.

The learned model can also be used to make predictions on new data:

```python
y_predicted = model.predict(np.array([[4., 6.]])) 
print(y_predicted)
```

Command to run the Python script above:

```bash
python3 gpy_example.py
```

This command assumes that the Python script is saved as "gpy_example.py". It can be executed in the command line or terminal to run the script.
