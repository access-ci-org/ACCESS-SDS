Use Case: Use r-viridis for visualizing data in gradients of color in graphs and plots. The colors are distinctly different from each other in order to make interpretation easier.

Code details and examples:
Code:

```r
# Load the library
library(viridis)

# Create a plot
plot(volcano, col=viridis(100), main="Viridis Color Map")

# Generate a scatterplot
x <- rnorm(1000)
y <- rnorm(1000)
plot(x, y, col=viridis(10)[as.numeric(cut(y,breaks=10))], pch=20, cex=2)
```

This code first loads the viridis library, and then it creates a 3D effect plot using the data from the volcano dataset, a topographic representation of Maunga Whau Volcano, that comes with base R. The plot is colored according to the viridis palette, which ranges from bluish-green to yellow.

Then, the code generates a scatterplot of random numbers. The color of the points correspond to the y-value of the points, separated into 10 bins, then colored according to the viridis palette. The parameter 'pch=20' indicates the shape of the points, solid circles. The 'cex=2' parameter makes the points 2 times their normal size. 

Command to run the code: 

This code can be executed within any R environment simply by copying and pasting it. If running from a Unix command line, the code would need to be saved to a file, e.g. 'script.r', then it can be executed with the following:

Command:

```sh
Rscript script.r
```
