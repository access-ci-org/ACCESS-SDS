Use Case: LZO is a data compression library that emphasizes on speedy operations. It is mostly used for fast compression and decompression of data, for instance, in network communication or file compression.

Code details and examples:
    
Code in C:

```
#include <stdio.h>
#include <lzo/lzoconf.h>
#include <lzo/lzo1x.h>

int main()
{ 
    if(lzo_init() != LZO_E_OK)
    {
        printf("internal error - lzo_init() failed !!!\n");
        printf("(this usually indicates a compiler bug - try recompiling\nwithout optimizations, and enable `-DLZO_DEBUG' for diagnostics)\n");
    return 1;
}
```

In this example, the lzo_init() function is called to initialize the LZO library. If the initialization is unsuccessful, it prints an error message. Note, there are no input files in this case.

Command to compile and run:

To compile the C code with LZO, you would need to link the LZO library. It is usually done in this way:

`gcc my_file.c -llzo2 -o my_program`

To run the program, use the following:

`./my_program`
