Use Case: Poetry is a Python package manager that simplifies dependency management and packaging. It's often used for installing and managing Python dependencies in software projects.

Code details and examples:

Code: 
A simple `pyproject.toml` file looks something like this:

```
[tool.poetry]
name = "helloworld"
version = "0.1.0"
description = ""
authors = ["Your Name <you@email.com>"]

[tool.poetry.dependencies]
python = "^3.8"

[build-system]
requires = ["poetry>=0.12"]
build-backend = "poetry.masonry.api"
```

In the above file, the `name`, `version`, `description` and `authors` are project metadata. `python = "^3.8"` declares that this project requires Python 3.8 or any later version. 

If you had further dependencies (say, a package named `requests`), you would add it in the `tool.poetry.dependencies` section like so:

```
[tool.poetry.dependencies]
python = "^3.8"
requests = "^2.25.1"
```

Command to run:
Once the project is configured you can install all dependencies using:

```shell
poetry install
```

And to run the project you would use:

```shell
poetry run python yourscript.py
```
