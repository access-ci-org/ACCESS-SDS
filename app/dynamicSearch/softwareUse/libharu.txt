Use Case: Creating a PDF document with embedded graphics and text in C/C++ using the libHaru library. 

Code details and examples:

Code:
```
#include <hpdf.h>

int main (int argc, char **argv)
{
    HPDF_Doc  pdf;
    HPDF_Page page;
    char fname[256];
    HPDF_Font font;

    strcpy (fname, argv[0]);
    strcat (fname, ".pdf");

    pdf = HPDF_New (NULL, NULL);
    if (!pdf) {
        printf ("error: cannot create PdfDoc object\n");
        return 1;
    }

    /* Add a new page object. */
    page = HPDF_AddPage (pdf);

    font = HPDF_GetFont (pdf, "Helvetica", NULL);

    HPDF_Page_SetFontAndSize (page, font, 24);

    HPDF_Page_BeginText (page);
    HPDF_Page_TextOut (page, 60, 750, "Hello, World!");
    HPDF_Page_EndText (page);

    /* Save the document to a file */
    HPDF_SaveToFile (pdf, fname);

    /* Clean up */
    HPDF_Free (pdf);

    return 0;
}
```
To compile and run this code, use the gcc compiler with `-lhpdf` to link the libharu library:

Compile command:
```
gcc main.c -lhpdf -o testpdf
```

Run command:
```
./testpdf
```
This will generate a PDF file named 'testpdf.pdf' in the same directory. 

Input files: There are no input files required directly by the libharu library in this use case. 

Format required: In this use case, the format/input is C/C++ source code and user's need to compile it with gcc compiler including libharu library.

Specifications and details in input files: In this use case, the input is a C/C++ source code file, which uses the libHaru API functions to create and write a simple PDF document with static text. The .c file should be written according to C/C++ syntax and semantics. The libHaru API functions should be called as per the official libHaru documentation.
