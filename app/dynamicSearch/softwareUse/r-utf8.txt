Use Case: The R package 'utf8' is commonly used to manipulate and analyze data that contains non-ASCII characters. It is particularly useful when working with languages that are not well represented in the ASCII table like Russian, Chinese, or Arabic.

Code details and examples:

Code:

```R
# Load the library
library(utf8)

# Define a UTF-8 string
text <- "你好"

# Check if the string is valid UTF-8
valid <- utf8_valid(text)
print(valid) # Should return TRUE as "你好" is valid UTF8

# Convert the string to ASCII
# Non-ASCII characters will be replaced with question marks
ascii <- utf8_encode(text, "ASCII")
print(ascii) # Should print "??"
```
To run the code, you should:

1. Save it in a script file (like `utf8_example.R`).
2. Execute the script using Rscript from your command line: `Rscript utf8_example.R`. Note that this assumes that Rscript is in your system PATH, which would typically be the case if R is installed normally.
