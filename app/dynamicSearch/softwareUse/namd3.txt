Use Case: NAMD (NAnoscale Molecular Dynamics) is an open source molecular dynamics software package that can run on high-performance parallel supercomputers and clusters, or on standalone desktop and laptop computers. It is used for large scale simulations of biological macromolecules.

Code details and examples:

File: Configuration file
A configuration file is needed to specify parameters for a NAMD simulation.

Content:
```
coordinates       alanin.pdb
outputName        alanin
bincoordinates    alanin.restart.coor
paraTypeCharmm    on
parameters        alanin.params
exclude           scaled1-4
```

File: PDB (Protein Data Bank) file.
This file contains the coordinates of each atom of the system to be simulated. 

Content:
```
ATOM      1  CA  ALA A   1      10.832  13.722  13.450  1.00  2.52           C
```

File: Parameter file
This file contains the parameters of each atom of the system to be simulated.

Content:
```
MASS    1 H      1.008   ! Hydrogen
```

File: Sequence file
This file contains the sequence of amino acids of the protein to be simulated.

Content:
```
ALA     1
```

Command to run: 
Use "charmrun" to start a simulation. Command is run in the terminal:

```
charmrun namd2 +p32 +setcpuaffinity alanin.conf > output.log
```

Here, "+p32" represents number of processors used, "alanin.conf" is the configuration file and "output.log" captures the simulation output.
