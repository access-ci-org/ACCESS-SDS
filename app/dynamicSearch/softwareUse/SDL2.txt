Use Case: SDL2 is a cross-platform software development library, used to create high-performance applications that are portable across different platforms. It is used for game development, multimedia applications that require rendering of 2D images/graphics, and handling audio, keyboard, mouse, joystick, events, and threads.

Code Details and Examples:

Code:

# Include the SDL library
#include <SDL2/SDL.h>

int main(int argc, char* args[]) 
{ 
   // Initializing SDL
   if (SDL_Init(SDL_INIT_EVERYTHING) < 0) 
   { 
      printf("SDL could not initialize! SDL_Error: %s\n", SDL_GetError()); 
   } 
   else 
   { 
      // Create a window
      SDL_Window* window = SDL_CreateWindow("SDL Tutorial", SDL_WINDOWPOS_UNDEFINED, SDL_WINDOWPOS_UNDEFINED, 800, 600, SDL_WINDOW_SHOWN);
      if (window == nullptr) 
      { 
         printf("Window could not be created! SDL_Error: %s\n", SDL_GetError()); 
      } 
      else 
      { 
         // Wait for 3000 ms (3 seconds)
         SDL_Delay(3000);

         // Destroy the window
         SDL_DestroyWindow(window);

         // Quit SDL subsystems
         SDL_Quit(); 
      } 
   } 

   return 0; 
}

This code initializes SDL, creates a window with a given title and dimensions, waits for a certain amount of time (3 seconds in this case), then destroys the window and quits the SDL subsystems.

Command to run:

Assuming the code is in a file called `main.c`, it requires the SDL2 library installed and a C compiler (e.g., gcc):

`gcc main.c -o output -lSDL2`

Then to run: `./output`
