Use Case: The r-nleqslv is an R package used for solving non-linear equations. Its primary function is to find a root of a system of non-linear equations. 

Code details and examples:

Code: 

```
#Load the library
library(nleqslv)

# Input Function
eqn <- function(x) {
  c(
    x[1]*2 + x[2]*2 - 1,
    x[1]*-1 + x[2]*3 - 2
  )
}

# Initial point
x.start <- c(0, 0)

# Solve equations
solution <- nleqslv(x.start, eqn)

# Show solution
print(solution$x)
```

In this simple example, we defined a system of two nonlinear equations `x[1]*2 + x[2]*2 - 1` and `x[1]*-1 + x[2]*3 - 2`. `x.start` is the initial point from which to start the search for the solution. `nleqslv` is the function used to solve the given system of equations.
