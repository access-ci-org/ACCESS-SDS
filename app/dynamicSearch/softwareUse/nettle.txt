Use Case: Nettle is a low-level cryptographic library that can be used for various cryptographic operations such as creating and verifying cryptographic hashes, encryption and decryption, and secure random number generation.

Code Details and Examples: Code

Sample Input Files: Nettle does not take input files in a formal sense, but data to be processed will usually be passed via memory buffers.

Format Required: Data to be processed needs to be in a memory buffer, or, depending on the function used, may need to be in a specific structure (such as a `nettle_cipher_ctx` for encryption/decryption)

Command to Run: As Nettle is a library, it needs to be called from within a C program. Here's a simple example using AES (Advanced Encryption Standard):

```c
#include <nettle/aes.h>

main()
{
    struct aes_ctx ctx;
    uint8_t plain[16];
    uint8_t cipher[16];
    uint8_t decrypted[16];
    uint8_t key[16];

    /* initialize key and plaintext */
    for(int i=0; i<16; i++) {
        key[i] = i;
        plain[i] = i;
    }

    /* set the encryption key */
    aes_set_encrypt_key(&ctx, 16, key);

    /* Encrypt the plaintext */
    aes_encrypt(&ctx, 16, cipher, plain);

    /* now set the decryption key - should be same as encryption key */
    aes_set_decrypt_key(&ctx, 16, key);

    /* Decrypt the cipher */
    aes_decrypt(&ctx, 16, decrypted, cipher);
}
```

This code creates and sets up an AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) context, and then encrypts and decrypts a 16-byte block of data. The data is given in the `plain` array, and the encryption key is in the `key` array. After running this code, the `decrypted` array should contain the original plaintext. You would build this program with a command like `gcc -o aes_example aes_example.c -lnettle`.
