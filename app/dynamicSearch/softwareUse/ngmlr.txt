Use Case: NGMLR is a long-read mapper designed to accurately align sequenced DNA from unknown genomes to a reference. Here we show the process of aligning a long read file with the reference genome.

Code details and examples:

The input files required are the read file in FASTQ or FASTA format and the reference genome in FASTA format.

For example, if your read file is 'reads.fasta' and the reference is 'reference.fasta', 

Code: 
```shell
ngmlr -r reference.fasta -q reads.fasta -o output.sam
```

In the above code, '-r' represents the reference file, '-q' represents the query file and '-o' specifies the output file name.
