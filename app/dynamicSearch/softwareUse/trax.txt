Use Case: Trax is a Python library for deep learning that allows you to perform machine learning tasks. It is often used for natural language processing, and here, we assume to train a sentiment analysis model for a dataset of text with associated sentiment labels.

Code details and examples:

The input data must be in a format compatible with Trax's `data.SerializedSequence` format. Let's assume you have a dataset in a CSV format where the first column is the text, and the second column is the sentiment label (0 for negative, 1 for positive).

```python
import trax
from trax.data import inputs

def load_dataset(file_path):
    return trax.data.SerializedSequence(file_path, input_transforms=[
        inputs.Pad(pad_value=0), inputs.EosId()])
```

To use the Trax library, you will first need to define your model. Let's create a simple model using Trax's layers:

```python
from trax import layers as tl

def create_model():
    return tl.Serial(
        tl.Embedding(vocab_size=8192, d_model=256),
        tl.Mean(),
        tl.Dense(2),
        tl.LogSoftmax()
    )
```

Next, you'll need to train your model using your dataset:

```python
from trax.supervised import training

def train_model(model, train_data, eval_data):
    train_task = training.TrainTask(
        labeled_data=train_data,
        loss_layer=tl.CrossEntropyLoss(),
        optimizer=trax.optimizers.Adam(0.01),
        n_steps_per_checkpoint=500,
    )

    eval_task = training.EvalTask(
        labeled_data=eval_data,
        metrics=[tl.CrossEntropyLoss(), tl.Accuracy()],
    )

    training_loop = training.Loop(
        model,
        tasks=[train_task],
        eval_tasks=[eval_task],
        output_dir="./model/",
    )

    training_loop.run(n_steps=10000) # Run for 10000 steps
```

Run the above in this command:
```python
model = create_model()
train_data = load_dataset("train.csv")
eval_data = load_dataset("eval.csv")
train_model(model, train_data, eval_data)
```

This will train a model on the `train.csv` dataset, evaluate it using the `eval.csv` dataset, and save the trained model to the `./model/` directory. The model is a simple neural network with an embedding layer, a mean-reducing layer, a dense layer, and a logarithmic softmax layer. It uses the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.01 and will save a checkpoint every 500 steps. The evaluation metrics are cross-entropy loss and accuracy.
