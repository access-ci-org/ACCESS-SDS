Use Case: Fastx-Toolkit is a collection of command line tools for Short-Reads FASTA/FASTQ files preprocessing. It can be used for quality filtering, trimming of reads and many more applications.

Code Details and Examples:

Code:

Fastq Quality Filter
-----------------------
This tool filters out low-quality reads based on the quality scores in your input fastq file. 

Input file format: A fastq file to be quality checked. Quality scores should be phred +33.

Command to run it:
```
fastq_quality_filter -Q33 -q 20 -p 80 -i input.fastq -o output.fastq
```
Where:
-Q33 specifies the phred scale of quality scores
-q is the minimum quality score to retain a read
-p is the minimum percentage of bases that must have the quality as specified by -q
-i specifies the input file
-o specifies the output file

Fastq Trim Tool
-------------------
This tool trims low-quality bases from the 3'-end of reads until it comes across a base with a quality score above the threshold.

Input file format: A fastq file with sequence reads to be trimmed. Quality scores should be phred +33.

Command to run it:
```
fastq_quality_trimmer -Q33 -t 20 -l 20 -i input.fastq -o output.fastq
```
Where:
-Q33 specifies the phred scale of quality scores
-t is the minimum quality score, below which trimming will occur.
-l is the minimum length of reads to be kept.
-i specifies the input file
-o specifies the output file

Remember to replace input.fastq and output.fastq with the names of your own files.
