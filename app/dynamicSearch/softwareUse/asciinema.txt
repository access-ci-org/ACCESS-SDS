Use Case: Asciinema is a free and open source command-line based solution for recording the terminal sessions and sharing them online. It's used by software engineers for showing how a specific program works, in bug reports, during blogs, and many other cases.

Code Details and Examples: Code 

To start recording with asciinema, you call:

`asciinema rec`

This command starts recording all terminal activity. The recording is only interrupted once you type `exit` or press `Ctrl-D`.

To replay a recording locally in your terminal you call:

`asciinema play <filename>`

Where `<filename>` is the path to your saved asciinema session file. 

If you want to share the recording online, you don't need to upload the file manually. Just call `asciinema upload <filename>` and it will be uploaded to asciinema.org where you can share it with anyone.

Asciinema doesnâ€™t require any program-specific data and uses plaintext, so there are no input files to provide. As well, since asciinema is meant to be used as a command line tool, there are no code snippets to provide.

Command to Run: All of asciinema's functionality is accessible through its command line interface. The commands to record, play, and upload sessions are `asciinema rec`, `asciinema play <filename>`, and `asciinema upload <filename>`, respectively
