Use Case: The ncdf4 package in R is used to create NetCDF files and extract data from the NetCDF files. It is primarily used in meteorology, geoscience and environmental science to store multi-dimensional arrays pertaining to spatial data, such as climate data, satellite data, etc.

Code details and examples:

Code:

To open netCDF:

```
library(ncdf4)
# Open a NetCDF file
nc <- nc_open("example.nc")
```

To extract data:

```
# Extract data from the netCDF file
data <- ncvar_get(nc, "Temperature")

# Close the netCDF file
nc_close(nc)
```

The input file is a NetCDF file ("example.nc"). The format is a binary file format for 'self-describing datasets'. Within the file, it comprises dimensions (e.g., time, longitude, latitude), variables (e.g., Temperature, Climate) and attributes (metadata).

To create netCDF file:

```
# Create dimensions
dim1 <- ncdim_def("Time", "days since 2000-01-01", 0:364)
dim2 <- ncdim_def("Longitude", "degrees_east", -180:180)
dim3 <- ncdim_def("Latitude", "degrees_north", -90:90)

# Create variables
var <- ncvar_def("Temperature", "K", list(dim1, dim2, dim3))

# Create a new NetCDF file
nc <- nc_create("output.nc", var)

# Add data to the new NetCDF file
ncvar_put(nc, var, runif(length(dim1)*length(dim2)*length(dim3)))

# Close the NetCDF file
nc_close(nc)
```

Command to run: You can run the code in any R environment, such as RStudio. There aren't specific commands to run in the command line, as R is often run interactively.

Please note: This is a simplified and illustrative example. The construction of NetCDF files can be complex depending on the dataset's characteristics and requirements.
