Use Case: Strique is a bioinformatics software used for analyzing the striation pattern in striated muscle cells in microscopical images.

Code details and examples: Code

Input file format: A grayscale or color image in a standard format like .jpg, .png etc. 

Input file specifications: The image should be of striated muscle cells under a microscope. 

Example input file: 'muscle.jpg'

Code Snippet to run the Software:

```
# Importing the required modules
from strique.code.strique import Strique

# Creating the Strique object
s = Strique("path/to/muscle.jpg")

# Executing the analyze function
s.analyze()

# Display results
print(s.report)
```
The command to run the software depends on the context in which the code is being executed. A command line prompt might look like this:

```bash
python3 script_using_strique.py
```
Where `script_using_strique.py` is a python script using strique for analysis as shown above. The path to the image analyzed ('path/to/muscle.jpg') is expected to be replaced with the actual path to the image file.
