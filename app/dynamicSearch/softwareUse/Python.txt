Use Case: To use Python for doing basic statistical analysis with the pandas library.

Code Details and Examples: 

 ```python
 # Import Required Library
 import pandas as pd
 
 # Create a Sample Dataset
 data = {"Name": ["Tom", "Nick", "John", "Tom", "John"],
         "Age": [20, 21, 19, 20, 18],
         "Rating": [4.23, 3.24, 3.98, 2.56, 3.20]}
 df = pd.DataFrame(data)
 
 # Display Basic Statistics
 print(df.describe())
 ```
The input here is a dictionary with keys as "Name", "Age", "Rating" and values are the corresponding list of values. There is no specific format requirement for the dictionary. The sample output for this code will look like: 

```
             Age    Rating
count   5.000000  5.000000
mean   19.600000  3.442000
std     1.140175  0.694285
min    18.000000  2.560000
25%    19.000000  3.200000
50%    20.000000  3.240000
75%    20.000000  3.980000
max    21.000000  4.230000
```
This code snippet performs basic statistical computation like count, mean, min, 25%, 50%, 75%, and max.

The command to run the python script is: `python filename.py` in the terminal, where filename.py is the python file containing this code.
