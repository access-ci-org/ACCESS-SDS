Use Case: SCNIC (Sparse Cooccurrence Network Investigation for Compositional data) is a tool used for analyzing microbial compositional data. It uses correlation based approaches to infer networks from compositional data.

Code Details and Examples:

a) To build correlation network with cutoff of 0.35 and visualize,

Code:

```python
from SCNIC import correls

# your input dataframe here
data = ...

correls = correls.make_correls(data, method='spearman')
module_table, correlation_table = correls.iterative_sc(correls, sparcc=True, minr=0.35)
correlation_table.to_csv('correlation_table_sparcc.csv')
module_table.to_csv('module_table_sparcc.csv')
```

Note: The input file for SCNIC is a pandas dataframe which consists of abundance of microbes in various samples. Row indices are microbes and column indices are samples.

b) To perform SparCC with a minimum correlation of 0.3,

Code:

```python
from SCNIC import general
from SCNIC import sparcc as sp

# input data
df = ...

# make correls
correls = sp.sparcc(df)

# run spiec easi on data1: minimum influence score to keep of 0.3
correls = general.sparcc_correls(correls, minr=0.3)
```

c) To run correlation calculations like fastspar

Code:

```python
from SCNIC import corr_calc

# input data
df = ...

# calculating correlation
corrs = corr_calc.correlation(df, 'fastspar')

# saving correlation
corrs.to_csv('correlation_fastspar.csv')
```

To run the python script: python script_name.py

Make sure the data is in the correct format of pandas dataframe before running the SCNIC python scripts.  The command for executing this scripts is typically "`python script_name.py`". Replace "script_name.py" with the actual name of your python script.
