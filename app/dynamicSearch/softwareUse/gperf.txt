Use Case: gperf is used to generate perfect hash functions. User provides an input file containing keywords as input and gperf produces a C/C++ code that implements a perfect hash function. The produced function takes advantage of the fact that the keywords are known in advance;

Code details and examples: 

Input file format: 
* % - Start a declaration or a structure.
* %% - Mark the beginning or end of a list.
* Struct - Indicate that an additional structure should be output.

Sample Input file (keywords): 
```
%{
#include <string.h>
%}
%%
one, 1
two, 2
three, 3
four, 4
%%
int
keyword_code (register const char *str, register size_t len)
{
  static struct keyword_struct wordlist[] =
  {
    {"one",    1},
    {"two",    2},
    {"three",  3},
    {"four",   4},
  };

.
.
.
```
The file should save as .gperf for example keywords.gperf

Command to compile:
```sh
$ gperf < keywords.gperf > keywords.h
```

The generated C/C++ code "keywords.h" can then be used in your application to get perfect hashing.

C++ code snippet:

```cpp
#include "keywords.h"

int main() {
    keyword_struct *result = in_word_set("one", strlen("one"));
    if (result) {
        std::cout << "Keyword one found, code is: " << result->code << "\n";
    } else {
        std::cout << "Keyword not found.\n";
    }

    return 0;
}
```
