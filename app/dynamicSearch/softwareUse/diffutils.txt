Use Case: diffutils is a package of GNU utilities for finding the differences between files. You can use the diff command to show differences between two files, or each corresponding file in two directories. For example, you can compare two C programs to see if they are the same. The diff commands can include options that control format and other aspects of the output.

Code details and examples: 

Code:

Suppose you have two text files named file1.txt and file2.txt.

file1.txt:

```
This is line 1.
This is line 2.
This is line 3.
This is line 4.
```

file2.txt:

```
This is line 1.
This is an altered line 2.
This is line 3.
This is line 4.
```

Command to run the diff:

```bash
diff file1.txt file2.txt
```

Output:

```bash
2c2
< This is line 2.
---
> This is an altered line 2.
```

The output format implicitly specifies alterations on line 2 of file1.txt needed to make the files identical. "2c2" means that line 2 in file1.txt needs to be changed to match line 2 in file2.txt. The output lines that follow, denote the specific lines from each file. In this case, file1.txt (denoted by "<") contains the original line, and file2.txt (denoted by ">") contains the updated line.
