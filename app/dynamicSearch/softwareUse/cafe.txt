Use Case: cafe (Computational Analysis of gene Family Evolution) is used for statistical analysis of gene family evolution using a stochastic birth and death model. 

Code Details and Examples: Code 

Let's say we have an example data file ("families.txt") that holds gene family sizes in four species. Each line corresponds to one gene family.

Content of "families.txt":

```
Desc    Fam0 Fam1 Fam2
Sp1 4   2   2   
Sp2 4   2   2   
Sp3 3   2   2   
Sp4 1   1   1
```

Command line to run cafe:

```bash
cafe param.txt
```

In param.txt:

```
-load -i families.txt -t 3 -l reports/log.txt -p 0.05
```

Details about the parameters available in this software can be found in the user manual online.

The output is a report detailing the results of the analysis, including estimates of lambda (gene gain and loss rate), the number of gene families expanding, and contracting in each lineage.
