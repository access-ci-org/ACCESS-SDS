Use Case: Cray CCE (Cray Compiler Environment) is often used in supercomputing environments for parallel programming. It can be leveraged in the writing of code that can be distributed across a cluster of computers in order to maximize the computational efficiency.

Code details and examples: Code

Assuming there is a Fortran file called "hello.f90" with a simple hello world program.

```fortran
program hello
    print *, "Hello world!"
end program hello
```

To compile this Fortran source file using Cray CCE compiler, the CC and FTN environment variables should point to the correct compilers. The Fortran compiler can be used with:

```
CC=cc
FTN=ftn
${FTN} -o hello hello.f90
```

The preceding commands will create an executable called hello. To run the executable do:

```
aprun -n 1 ./hello
```

The "-n 1" argument to aprun specifies that 1 processing element should be used to run the job.
