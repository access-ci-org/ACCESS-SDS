Use Case: R_tamu is a data analytics and visualization tool. The package provides a range of methods for analyzing, interpreting, and visualizing complex datasets. 

Code details and examples: 

Code: 

# Loading the R_tamu library
library(R_tamu)

# Example data
data <- read.csv("example_data.csv")

# Analysis
results <- R_tamu.analyze(data)

# Visualization
R_tamu.plot(results)

This assumes that the 'example_data.csv' file exists and contains a dataset that is amenable to the analysis methods provided by R_tamu. If this were a data-frame with columns named X1, X2, ..., Xn, this could be a csv file with the following format:

X1,X2,...,Xn
value11,value12,...,value1n
value21,value22,...,value2n

The command to run the script (assuming the script is named script.R): Rscript script.R
