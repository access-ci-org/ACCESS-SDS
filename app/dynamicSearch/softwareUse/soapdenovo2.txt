Use Case: SOAPdenovo2 is designed to assemble short reads from NGS platforms like Illumina GA. It is widely used for creating de novo drafts of large genomes.

Code details and examples: 

Code: 

An implementation of SOAPdenovo2 would involve running the config file and executing the following commands:

```
SOAPdenovo-63mer all -s config_file -K 63 -R -o graph_prefix 1>ass.log 2>ass.err 
```
In this case, -s specifies the configuration file, -K is the k-mer size, -R resolves repeats by reads, -o is the output prefix.

Specifications and details in input files:

The config file is used to specify configuration details for SOAPdenovo2. A sample config file might look like this:

```
#maximal read length
max_rd_len=100
[LIB]
#average insert size
avg_ins=200
#if sequence needs to be reversed
reverse_seq=0
#in which part(s) the reads are used
asm_flags=3
#use only first 100 bps of each read
rd_len_cutoff=100
#in which order the reads are used while scaffolding
rank=1
# cutoff of pair number for a reliable connection (at least 3 for short insert size)
pair_num_cutoff=3 
#minimum aligned length to contigs for a reliable read location (at least 32 for short insert size)
map_len=32
#a pair of fastq file, read 1 file should always be followed by read 2 file
q1=lib1.R1.fq
q2=lib1.R2.fq
```

Please take it into account, links in the config file are specified under the [LIB] flag.

There are not specific input files for this software as it uses fastq files generated from sequencing, the configuration file is written in plain-text format.
