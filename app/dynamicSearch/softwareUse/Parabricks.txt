Use Case: Parabricks is a GPU-accelerated genomics analysis toolkit, which is used for performing variant calling in genomic sequencing data. It performs alignment, variant calling and annotation in a highly parallel manner, making it much faster than traditional methods.

Code details and examples: Code.

Files Required: 
Two FASTQ files (for paired-end sequencing data)

Input File Format:
FASTQ

Code to run alignment (pbrun aligner), variant calling (pbrun germline), and variant annotation (pbrun vep):

```
$ pbrun aligner --ref ref.fasta --in-fq sample_R1.fastq sample_R2.fastq --out-bam output.bam
$ pbrun germline --ref ref.fasta --bam output.bam --out-vcf output.vcf
$ pbrun vep --ref ref.fasta --in-vcf output.vcf --out-vcf output_annotated.vcf
```

Where,
- `--ref` is the reference genome in FASTA format.
- `--in-fq` represents the input FASTQ files (paired-end in this case).
- `--out-bam` is the output file in BAM format after alignment.
- `--bam` is the input file in BAM format for variant calling.
- `--out-vcf` is the output file in VCF format after variant calling.
- `--in-vcf` is the input file in VCF format for annotation.
