Use Case: Use cytoolz, a python library that offers utility functions for fast, memory-efficient toolz like set, list, dict, and other iterables. This is beneficial when working with large datasets that cannot all load into memory. 

Code details and examples: 

Code: 

```python
from cytoolz import itertoolz

# Create an iterable
iterable = range(10)

# Create an iterable of pairs.
pairs = itertoolz.pairwise(iterable)

# Print all pairs
print(list(pairs))
```

Input files: No input file is needed.

Format required: N/A

Any specifications and details in input files: N/A

Command to run the code: This code can be run in a Python environment by invoking the Python interpreter and running the code. E.g. `python3 filename.py` 

Note that output will be `[(0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 5), (5, 6), (6, 7), (7, 8), (8, 9)]`.
