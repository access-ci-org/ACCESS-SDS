Use Case: Use AOCL for compiling high performance scientific computing codes written in C/C++ or Fortran. AOCL includes the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC), Gnu Project Debugger (GDB), and mathematical libraries. Compiled codes can run faster on AMD CPUs.

Code details and examples: Code

Input Files: A C++ source code file (.cpp extension)

Format Required: Text file with C++ code

Code Snippet:

```c++
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    cout<<"Hello, World!";
    return 0;
}
```

Save the code in a file called hello.cpp.

Command to compile the C++ code using AOCL:

```bash
g++ hello.cpp -o hello
```

Specifications and Details: The hello.cpp file contains the source code that prints "Hello, World!" to the console. The `g++` command compiles the C++ source code. The `-o` option specifies the output file name.

Command to run the compiled code:

```bash
./hello
```

The `./hello` command runs the compiled code. The output will print "Hello, World!" to the console.
