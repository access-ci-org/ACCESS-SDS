Use Case: MOB-suite is a software tool suited for fast bacterial plasmid typing from whole-genome sequence (WGS) reads. This tool can be used to do de-novo plasmid assembly, MOB typing (predict the relaxase and conjugal transfer proteins), and perform matching to a database of reference plasmids.

Code Details and Examples: Code

Input files format required: mob-suite tool requires two types of input files for execution. The input files are in FASTA or FASTQ format which includes the genomic sequencing data.

Here's an example of how you would provide sequence data in FASTA format.

Input file `sequence.fasta`:

```
>seq1
ATTGGCCATTGGCCATTGGCCA
>seq2
TGGCCAATTGGCCAATTGCCA
```

Command to run the tool: 

First command is for initial setup for first time user and database creation.

```
mob_init
export MOB_BLAST=$(mob_init --show_mob_suite_path)
```

Then for MOB-Recon, you would use input sequence in FASTA or FASTQ format as shown below.

```
mob_recon -i input.fasta -t <number_of_threads>
```

Extras: If using own reference database, then specify the path as shown,

```
mob_recon -i input.fasta -t <number_of_threads> --db /path/to/own/database
```

Similarly to use MOB-typer, you can use the below command:

```
mob_typer --infile input/sequence.fasta --run_typer
```

Finally for plasmid reconstruction and typing you can use,

```
mob_typer --run_typer --infasta input.fasta --outdir output_directory
```
