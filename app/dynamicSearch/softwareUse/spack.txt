Use Case: Spack is a package management system designed to support multiple versions, configurations, platforms, and compilers. It is used to simplify the process of building and installing various software packages, allowing developers to manage complex install trees and dependencies. Sample use case can be installing a software 'cmake' using spack.

Code details and examples:

Code:

To install a software 'cmake' using spack, we use the following command.

```
spack install cmake
```

To load the installed software:

```
spack load cmake
```

In some cases, you might need to specify the version of the package or the compiler you want to use. For example:

```
spack install cmake@3.15.2
spack install cmake%gcc@9.2.0
```

The "@" character is used to specify the version, and the "%" character is used to specify the compiler.

Spack uses YAML-based package recipes, which are very simple to write. A minimal spack package could be something as simple as:

```
class Cmake(Package):
    homepage = "http://www.cmake.org"
    url      = "http://www.cmake.org/files/v2.8/cmake-2.8.10.2.tar.gz"

    version('2.8.10.2', '097278785da7182ee14c7cb44fb14c47')

    def install(self, spec, prefix):
        configure("--prefix=%s" % prefix)
        make()
        make("install")
```

Input files, format required, and specifications:

Spack does not necessarily take an input file but requires a package recipe written in Python, staying within Spackâ€™s DSL. With very few exceptions, the API provided by the package DSL is the only thing needed to install a package. The specification is generally the software name accompanied by its version and other details.
