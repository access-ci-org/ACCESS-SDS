Use Case: SingleM is an open-source package used for fast taxonomic profiling of metagenomic datasets. It's specially designed to accurately profile microbial community composition from shotgun metagenome data.

Code details and examples: 

Code: 
SingleM commands are usually run with the singlem package, which has several different subcommands, one for each function.

Typical usage is as follows:

```
singlem pipe --sequences sequences.fastq --otu_table otu_table.csv
```

In this case, "sequences.fastq" is the input FASTQ sequence file, and "otu_table.csv" is the output file where the OTU table will be written.

Input Files:

1. Sequences file in FASTQ format. This file contains the sequences to be processed. Each sequence record consists of a sequence identifier, the sequence itself, a separator line and a sequence quality line.

2. The pipeline requires a reference package, which can be obtained using the "singlem prepare" command. If no reference package is specified, SingleM uses a default set of packages.

Format required: 
The input file is expected to be in FASTQ format. This is a standard file format used for storing the output of high-throughput sequencing machines. 

Specifications and details in input files:
1. Every sequence has a unique identifier, and the sequences are separated by lines containing only the '+' character.
2. Each sequence must be accompanied by a corresponding quality line, which contains ASCII characters representing the confidence of each base call.

Command to run:
The typical command to run a SingleM pipeline is as follows:

```
singlem pipe --sequences sequences.fastq --otu_table otu_table.csv
```

This command will run the SingleM pipeline on the sequences file "sequences.fastq" and write the output to "otu_table.csv".
