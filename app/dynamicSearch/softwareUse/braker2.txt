Use Case: BRAKER2 is a pipeline for fully automated prediction of protein coding genes in novel eukaryotic genomes. It uses GeneMark-ES, GeneMark-ET, and GeneMark-EP plus mapping of proteins (using BLAST and GeneWise) onto the genome, as evidence for gene prediction with AUGUSTUS.

Code Details and Examples: 

Code:

The most basic command to run BRAKER2, given that you have a genome fasta file and a protein sequence database:

```bash
braker.pl --species=SPECIES --genome=genome.fa --prot_seq=proteins.fa --prg=gth --workingdir=$PWD/braker --cores 8
```

In this example:

- `--species=SPECIES` helps in defining the species. `SPECIES` is a unique identifier for the current species to be annotated.
- `--genome=genome.fa` is the Genome sequence file in FASTA format.
- `--prot_seq=proteins.fa` indicates the protein sequences in fasta format.
- `--prg=gth` enables gene prediction with GenomeThreader.
- `--workingdir=$PWD/braker` specifies the working directory.
- `--cores 8` specifies that the program can use 8 processors for processing.

Please refer to the BRAKER2 manual (https://github.com/Gaius-Augustus/BRAKER) to understand the different options and to learn more about how to prepare your input files.

Input Files:

1. Genome sequence file (genome.fa) in FASTA format.
2. Protein sequences (proteins.fa) are required for Evidence Modeler in FASTA format.

Note: To perform an annotation, BRAKER2 requires that genome containing masked interspersed repeats and correctly formatted species-specific configuration files for AUGUSTUS are provided.
