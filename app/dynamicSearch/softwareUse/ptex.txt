Use Case: The ptex library is a Python wrapper for the LaTex typesetting system. It allows users to write and compile LaTex documents directly from Python scripts or applications, offering a flexible environment for scientific writing, presenting mathematical formulae and structured documents.

Code details and examples:
Code:

```py
from pylatex import Document, Section, Subsection, Command
from pylatex.utils import italic, NoEscape

doc = Document("mydocument")

doc.preamble.append(Command('title', 'Awesome Title'))
doc.preamble.append(Command('author', 'Anonymous author'))
doc.preamble.append(Command('date', NoEscape('\\today')))
doc.append(NoEscape('\\maketitle'))

# Adding sections, subsections and text to the document
with doc.create(Section('A section')):
    doc.append('Some regular text and some ')
    doc.append(italic('italic text. '))
    doc.append('\nAlso some crazy characters: $&#{}')
   
    with doc.create(Subsection('A subsection')):
        doc.append('Some more text.')
    
doc.generate_pdf(clean_tex=False)
```

The Python script above creates a LaTeX document named "mydocument.tex". In this .tex file, a title, author, and the current date are set. Regular and italic text is added in a section, along with some characters regularly used in LaTeX. A subsection is added with some more text. 

Then, the .tex is compiled into a PDF. Without cleanup, both the .tex and .pdf files will be left in the directory.

Run command: python create_document.py

Please note that the Python environment should have the pylatex installed.
