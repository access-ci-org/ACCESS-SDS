Use Case: MarginPolish is a nanopore consensus pipeline that uses a neural network for improving draft assemblies. Its use case involve scientific and biomedical applications such as genomic sequence analysis and identifying novel genetic variants.

Code details and examples: Code

MarginPolish operates on hdf5 files which provide a succinct representation of the multiple sequence alignment between reads and a reference sequence, and any feature values computed on them.

Input files:
1. Reads in fasta/fastq format.
2. Alignment in BAM format. 
3. Reference genome in FASTA format.

Command Line to Execute:
```
marginPolish assembly_draft.fa reads.sorted.bam params.json polishingDraft.fa
```
In this command,
- `assembly_draft.fa` is the draft assembly
- `reads.sorted.bam` is the alignment of your reads to draft assembly 
- `params.json` is a parameter file in JSON format that specifies program settings
- `polishingDraft.fa` is the output polished draft file.

The settings in parameter file (`params.json`) include information like the number of threads to use, gap scoring parameters, and information about the neural network model to use. A sample `params.json` file might look like:
```
{
    "polish" : {
        "align" : {
            "command" : "bwa mem -x ont2d -t 1 REF INPUT | samtools view -Sb - | samtools sort -T tmp - | samtools view -h -o OUTPUT -",
            "chunkSize" : 10000000,
            "sanityCheck" : false,
            "verbose" : false
        }
}
```
