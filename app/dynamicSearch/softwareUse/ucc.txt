Use Case: Compute matrix multiplication in large-scale mathematical operations with the academic software package UCC (Universal Cluster Computing).

Code details and examples: Code.

Input file:

The input file needs to be a .txt file with two matrices written line by line (each line represents a row of the matrix) separated by a blank line. For example:

```
1 2 3
4 5 6

7 8
9 10
11 12
```
This represents two matrices: [1 2 3; 4 5 6] and [7 8; 9 10; 11 12]

Command to run:

```bash
ucc matmul -i input.txt -o output.txt
```
This command will execute the matrix multiplication task in UCC (Universal Cluster Computing) with the `-i` option indicating the input file and `-o` the output file. The task `matmul` is the task of performing matrix multiplication.
