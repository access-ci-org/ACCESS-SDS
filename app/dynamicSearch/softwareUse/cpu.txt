Use Case: Analyzing CPU performance using the "psutil" Python library. This library provides an interface for retrieving information on running processes and system utilization.

Code details and examples:
Code:

```python
import psutil

# Get the CPU usage
print("The CPU usage is: ", psutil.cpu_percent())

# Get the number of logical CPUs in the system
print("The number of logical CPUs is: ", psutil.cpu_count())
```

This script doesn't require any input files. However, the "psutil" module must be present in the Python environment. It should be run directly in a Python environment, which may be initiated using the `python` or `python3` command in the command line.

Command to run this python script:

```bash
python cpu_usage.py
```

In this example, `cpu_usage.py` is the name of the file containing the script.
