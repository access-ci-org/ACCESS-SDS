Use Case: Miniasm is a very fast OLC-based de novo assembler for noisy long reads, such as those produced by PacBio or Oxford Nanopore technologies. It takes all-vs-all raw read alignment information as input and outputs an assembly graph in the GFA format. Different from mainstream assemblers, miniasm does not have a consensus step. It simply concatenates pieces of read sequences to generate the final unitig sequences. Thus the per-base error rate is similar to the raw input reads.

Code details and examples:

To run miniasm, you need a set of all-vs-all alignment records in PAF format and a set of reads in FASTA/FASTQ format.

Code:

1. Run minimap2 to perform all-vs-all raw read overlapping:

```
minimap2 -x ava-pb -t8 pb-reads.fq.gz pb-reads.fq.gz | gzip -1 > overlaps.paf.gz
```
This command will generate a file called `overlaps.paf.gz` that contains all-vs-all overlapping information of the input reads.

2. Run miniasm program to generate the assembly graph in GFA format:

```
miniasm -f pb-reads.fq.gz overlaps.paf.gz > output.gfa
```
This command will generate a file called `output.gfa` that contains the assembly graph of the input reads.

Input Files Formatting: Input files should be in FASTA/FASTQ format or PAF format.

Input File Formatting for FASTA/FASTQ: FASTA/FASTQ is a text-based format for representing either nucleotide sequences or peptide sequences, in which nucleotides or amino acids are represented using single-letter codes. 

Code Sample:

\>sequence1                
ATCGATCGATCGATCGTACGTACGTACGTACGTACG

Input File Formatting for PAF: PAF is a text format describing the alignment of two sets of sequences that could be long, such as several kilobases or a chromosome.

Code Sample:

utg000001l    4361    678     1582    +       utg000002l    5906    105     768     1194    904     60

Where each column represents the following:

1. Query sequence name
2. Query sequence length
3. Query start
4. Query end
5. Strand
6. Target sequence name
7. Target sequence length
8. Target start
9. Target end
10. Number of residue matches
11. Alignment block length
12. Mapping quality.

The command to run them:

```minimap2 -x ava-pb -t8 pb-reads.fq.gz pb-reads.fq.gz | gzip -1 > overlaps.paf.gz```
```miniasm -f pb-reads.fq.gz overlaps.paf.gz > output.gfa```
