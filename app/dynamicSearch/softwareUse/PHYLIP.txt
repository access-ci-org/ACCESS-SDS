Use Case: PHYLIP is a suite of programs for inferring phylogenies (evolutionary trees). It is widely used in evolutionary biology research to generate phylogenetic trees from molecular data.

Code details and examples:

Code:
The input file for most of the PHYLIP programs is a text file in a specific format. The first line of the file contains two integers separated by spaces. The first integer is the number of taxa, and the second integer is the number of characters in the sequence. This is followed by a list of sequences, one line per taxon. Each line begins with the name of the taxa (up to 10 characters), followed by the sequence. Spaces and numbers are ignored.

For example, an input for the "dnaml" program, which infers phylogenies from nucleotide sequences using maximum likelihood, could look like this:

```
5 13
Taxon_1    AACGTAGTCACAC
Taxon_2    AACGTAGGCACAC
Taxon_3    AAGGTAAACATAA
Taxon_4    AAGGTAAGCATTA
Taxon_5    AAGATTATTAATA
```

In this example, '5' is the number of taxa and '13' is the number of characters in the sequence. Each line after this represents a taxon (species or individual) and its DNA sequence.

Note that the sequences don't have to be DNA. PHYLIP includes programs for protein sequences and distance matrices too.

To run the "dnaml" program with this input, you could use the following command in the terminal:

```bash
dnaml < input.txt > output.txt
```

In this command, 'input.txt' is the name of your input file, and 'output.txt' will be the name of the output file that PHYLIP creates.
