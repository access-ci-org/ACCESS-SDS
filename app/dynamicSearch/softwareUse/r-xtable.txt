Use Case: Creating a descriptive statistics table in a reproducible way for inclusion in a report; calculating and presenting descriptive statistics for different groups.

Code details and examples:

Code: 

```R
library(xtable)

# Assuming that the `mtcars` dataset is used

data(mtcars)

# Calculating descriptive statistics
desc_stat <- summary(mtcars)

# Displaying the descriptive statistics as a table
desc_stat_table <- xtable(desc_stat)

# Printing the table with xtable style
print.xtable(desc_stat_table, type = "html")
```

In this example, the input is the `mtcars` dataset, which comes pre-installed with R. The summary() function is used to calculate the descriptive statistics and the xtable() function from the `xtable` library packages these statistics into an object that can be printed as a table. The print.xtable() function is then used to display this table. The "html" argument tells R to print the table with `html` markup.
