Use Case: pytz is a Python library that allows accurate and cross-platform timezone calculations. It also solves the issue of ambiguous times at the end of daylight saving time, which can be an issue for many types of software.

Code details and examples: Code

Sample Code:
```
from datetime import datetime
import pytz

utc = pytz.utc
print("UTC time:", datetime.now(utc))

eastern = pytz.timezone('US/Eastern')
print("US/Eastern time:", datetime.now(eastern))
```
Command to run: `python3 sample_code.py` 

Sample Input File: No input file required.

Specifications and details in Input files: Not applicable. 

This script first imports `datetime` from the datetime module and `pytz`. It then creates `utc` as an instance of `UTC` timezone and prints the current time in `UTC` timezone. Similarly, it creates `eastern` as an instance of `US/Eastern` timezone and prints the current time in `US/Eastern` timezone.

The `pytz` library brings the Olson tz database into Python. This library allows accurate and cross-platform timezone calculations using Python `2.3` or higher. It also solves the issue of ambiguous times at the end of daylight saving time, which can be an issue for many types of software.
