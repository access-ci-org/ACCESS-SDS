Use Case: CGAL, the Computational Geometry Algorithms Library, is used for the computation of geometric operations like intersection of polygonal surfaces, 3D triangulation, 2D arrangements, etc. It is used in academia and industry for geometric computation. 

Code Details and Examples:

In this example, a Convex Hull operation, one of the geometric operations provided by CGAL, is performed. The input is a set of points in 2D or 3D.

Input File Format:

The standard file format is OFF (Object File Format). It consists of list of vertices and their coordinates denoted as follows:

OFF
# Number of vertices 
4
# Points
1 0 0
0 1 0
0 0 1
1 1 1

Code Snippet:

Here is a code snippet of CGAL in C++. 

```
#include <CGAL/Exact_predicates_inexact_constructions_kernel.h>
#include <CGAL/convex_hull_3.h>
#include <vector>

typedef CGAL::Exact_predicates_inexact_constructions_kernel K;
typedef K::Point_3 Point_3;

int main() {
    std::vector<Point_3> points;
    // Insert points
    points.push_back(Point_3(1,0,0));
    points.push_back(Point_3(0,1,0));
    points.push_back(Point_3(0,0,1));
    points.push_back(Point_3(1,1,1));
    
    std::vector<Point_3> result;
    CGAL::convex_hull_3(points.begin(), points.end(), std::back_inserter(result));
      
    return 0;
}
```
To run the code, use g++ compiler:

``` g++ -std=c++11 -I /path/to/CGAL-4.1/include/code.cpp -o output``` 

Replace `/path/to/CGAL-4.1/include/` with actual path to your CGAL include directory. Then run the output file:

```./output```
