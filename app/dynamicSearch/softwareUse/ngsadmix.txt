Use Case: Use Ngsadmix for ancestry analysis based on next generation sequencing (NGS) data

Code details and examples: Code

To use NGSadmix you would need a genotype likelihood file in beagle format or genotype posterior probabilities file from ANGSD. 

Sample input files:
Two input files are required: the genotype likelihood file (e.g., infile.beagle.gz) and the population information file (e.g., popinfo.txt).

The genotype likelihood file in beagle format may look like this (numbers are likelihoods for the genotype):

```
marker  ind1  ind2  ind3
locus1  0.90 0.05 0.05  0.90 0.05 0.05  0.10 0.20 0.70
locus2  0.90 0.05 0.05  0.90 0.05 0.05  0.10 0.20 0.70
locus3  0.90 0.05 0.05  0.90 0.05 0.05  0.10 0.20 0.70
```

The population information file would contain identifier with assigned population:

```
ind1 pop1
ind2 pop1
ind3 pop2
```

Command to run NGSadmix:

```
NGSadmix -likes infile.beagle.gz -K 2 -P 4 -minMaf 0.05 -outfiles ngsadmix_out
```
This command will run NGSadmix on the input file 'infile.beagle.gz'. The analysis is done for K=2 ancestral populations (which can be adjusted based on biological knowledge), and uses 4 processors (-P 4). The '-minMaf 0.05' specifies the minimum minor allele frequency to be considered in the analysis. The output files will be written in the 'ngsadmix_out' directory.
