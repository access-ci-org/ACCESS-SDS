Use Case: Using R and Bioconductor to perform bioinformatics analyses, process high-throughput genomics data, or download and install bioconductor packages.

Code details and examples: 

Code:

```r
# Loading Bioconductor Manager
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
    install.packages("BiocManager")

# Installing needed package
BiocManager::install("edgeR")

# Loading the package
library("edgeR")

# Sample data input
group <- factor(c(1,1,2,2,3,3)) # Three groups with two replicates each
counts <- matrix(rnbinom(600,size=20,mu=10), 100, 6)  # Random counts for 100 genes and 6 samples

# Setting up the DGEList object which is required for input
y <- DGEList(counts=counts, group=group)

# Applying normalization
y <- calcNormFactors(y)

# Design matrix 
design <- model.matrix(~group)

# Estimating dispersion
y <- estimateDisp(y, design)

# Applying Exact Test for differences between groups
et <- exactTest(y, pair=c("1","2"))

# Displaying top tags
topTags(et)
```

In this code, we create a sample inputs (group and counts) for a differential expression analysis using edgeR package. The counts are normalized using the `calcNormFactors` function, dispersion is estimated with `estimateDisp` and exactTest is performed.

Running the R script above can be done on a command line (assuming R is installed and the script is saved as script.R) with this command: 

```bash
Rscript script.R
```
