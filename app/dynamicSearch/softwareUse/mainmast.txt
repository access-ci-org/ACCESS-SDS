Use Case: MAINMAST(Membrane-Associated Internal symmetric three-dimensional MAtching and pairwise Sequence comparison Tool) is widely used for protein folding, docking, and 3D-QSAR study. Typical uses include protein structure prediction, protein fold recognition, and protein-protein interaction.

Code details and examples: Code.

Input File Format:

- The program primarily requires a PDB (Protein Data Bank) formatted file as input.
- The PDB file should contain the atomic coordinates of the protein's backbone.
- The file may also include optional secondary structure information.

Command to run MAINMAST:

There're different commands option based on the analysis requirement. Here is an example.

To predict protein structure:

```
/path/to/mainmast -i input.pdb -o output
```

Here, '-i' indicates the input PDB file and '-o' specifies the output directory or file name.

Please replace "/path/to/mainmast" with the actual path to the MAINMAST executable and "input.pdb" with your own PDB file.	Output description: 

After completion, the MAINMAST will create several files in the output directory. The most important one is "mainmast\_out.pdb," which comprises the protein structure predicted by MAINMAST.

Note: Ensure that the PDB file correctly formatted, otherwise MAINMAST won't be able to interpret it and might produce an empty or erroneous output.

Code sample:
```
# Load the protein structure
peptide = loadPDB('input.pdb')

# Compute MAINMAST
mainmast = MAINMAST(peptide)

# Save the prediction
savePDB('output.pdb', mainmast)
```

Note: This is a simplified representation. In true implementation, each PDB file would have multiple protein structures, and each would need to be processed individually. Also, considerations like the presence of X-ray crystallography data or probability distribution across different structures will also need to be taken into account.
