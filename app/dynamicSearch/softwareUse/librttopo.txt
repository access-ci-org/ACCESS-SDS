Use Case: The librttopo library is utilised for high performance spatial processing. It's an open-source library that implements numerous algorithms and data structures for geometric processing. If one were to use this library in their project, for instance, they might be assembling a mapping application and need to perform various spatial operations. They would load a shapefile containing polygon data, for instance, representing the borders of all countries in the world, and then apply a smoothing operation to these borders. 

Code details and examples: 

Code:

```python
# import librttopo library
from librttopo import rtgeom, rtcontext

# Load input file
ctx = rtcontext.RTCTX()
filename = 'your_input_file.sample'
with open(filename, 'r') as file:
    data = file.read()

# Parse the input data
geom = rtgeom.from_wkb(ctx, data)

# Apply some spatial operation, like smoothing
smoothed_geom = geom.smooth(ctx, 5)

# Convert the result back into WKB and save it
smoothed_data = smoothed_geom.to_wkb(ctx)
with open('smoothed_output.sample', 'w') as file:
    file.write(smoothed_data)
```

The input file for this example should be a WKB (Well-Known Binary) file. This is a binary format for representing geographic objects (points, lines, polygons, and so on). This means it's not a file format you can read and write by hand; it's meant to be read and written by software.

The above example also presupposes the use of the .smooth() method, which would smooth the borders of the polygons in the shapefile. Note that there are many other methods available in librttopo for diverse spatial operations. 

Regarding specifications and details in input files, they need to correctly follow the WKB or WKT (Well-Known Text) format. Furthermore, it should be highlighted that in order to correctly follow the formats, the order in which you list the coordinates of a polygon must follow the "right-hand rule", i.e., if your hand's fingers curl in the direction of the points, your thumb should point upwards. 

Command to run the code (if the file is named script.py):

```bash
python script.py
```
