Use Case: Use VASP (Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package) to perform ab initio quantum mechanical molecular dynamics (MD) using pseudo potentials and a plane wave basis set to simulate atomic scale systems. 

Code details and examples: Code

Vasp requires four input files, i.e., POSCAR, POTCAR, KPOINTS, and INCAR. 

1. POSCAR: Contains the position of ions
```
3.52
   1.0    0.0    0.0
   0.0    1.0    0.0
   0.0    0.0    1.0
   2    1

   0.0    0.0    0.0
   0.5    0.5    0.5
   0.25    0.25    0.25
```

2. POTCAR: This file is made by concatenating individual potentials for each element in your structure, file provided by VASP.
3. KPOINTS: Selects the k-point grid.
```
 Automatic mesh

 Gamma

 0 0 0
```

4. INCAR: Various tags.
```
  PREC = Medium ;
  IBRION = 2 ;
  ISIF = 3 ;
  EDIFF = 1E-5 ;
  NSW = 10 ;
  ISMEAR = 0 ;
  SIGMA = 0.05 ;
```

Command to run VASP:
If you're using a shell, you can submit a job script to your cluster using the command `sbatch`:
```bash
sbatch vasp.slurm
```
The contents of `vasp.slurm` may look something like this:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH --job-name=vasp_job
#SBATCH --output=output.out
#SBATCH --time=01:00:00
#SBATCH --ntasks=16

module load VASP
mpirun vasp_std
```

Keep in mind that you may have to change the details of your slurm script to match the requirements of your own HPC cluster, such as the time, ntasks, nodes, etc.
