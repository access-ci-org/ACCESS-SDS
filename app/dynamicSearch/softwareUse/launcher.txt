Use Case: The LAUNCHER is a simple utility HPC software for creating and managing dynamic host lists for simplified distribution of parallel MPI jobs. An example use could be running multiple instances of a script concurrently on different cores of a high performance computer.

Code Details and Examples: 

Code:

Here is a simple example of a paramlist file used with Launcher:

```paramlist.txt
./myscript.sh argument1
./myscript.sh argument2
./myscript.sh argument3
```

Each line contains a separate command which will be distributed to different cores of your HPC system.

Now, when using launcher, you would run:

```shell
export LAUNCHER_PLUGIN_DIR=<PATH_TO_PLUGIN>
export LAUNCHER_DIR=<PATH_TO_LAUNCHER>
export LAUNCHER_JOB_FILE=paramlist.txt
export LAUNCHER_NPROCS=3
export LAUNCHER_PPN=1
export LAUNCHER_SCHED=interleaved
PROMPT_COMMAND=''
$LAUNCHER_DIR/paramrun
```

These commands will set the necessary environment variables and run launcher with your desired configuration. 'LAUNCHER_NPROCS' should match the number of lines in your paramlist file, and 'LAUNCHER_PPN' can be used to specify how many cores should be used on each node.

There are various other environment variables that can be used to configure how launcher distributes jobs, for example 'LAUNCHER_RMI' can be used to specify the method of inter-node communication, and 'LAUNCHER_JOB_WALLTIME' can be used to set a maximum runtime for the jobs.

Note that the mentioned paths in the export commands need to be replaced with the actual paths in your system where the necessary files and directories reside.
