Use Case: gfaffix is used in graph theory and algorithmic problems. It is used for attaching unique numerical or textual identifiers to vertices of the graph. 

Code details and examples: 

Code: 

Here is a sample graph definition in gf/spec format that gfaffix might work on:

```
# This is comment
GF: network 8
# Link the vertices
E: Internet
E: ISP
E: HomeNetwork
E: Server
E: Workstation
E: Laptop
E: Tablet
E: Smartphone
# Define edges
L: Internet ISP
L: ISP HomeNetwork
L: HomeNetwork Server
L: HomeNetwork Workstation
L: HomeNetwork Laptop
L: HomeNetwork Tablet
L: HomeNetwork Smartphone
```

The conceptual command to run gfaffix might be something like this:

```
gfaffix network.gf result.net
```

Note: gfaffix is a fictional software presumed to act like graph-theoretic utility, and the input files and command presented here are equally hypothetical. The actual usage may totally vary depending on the real software functionalities and requirements.
