Use Case: Use r-nnet for creating neural networks in the R programming environment. Particularly useful for prediction analysis like prediction of house prices, weather conditions, and customer segment prediction based on their buying behavior.

Code details and examples: Code

Sample Input for r-nnet:

```R
# Load libraries
library(nnet)
library(caret)
# Data
data(iris)
# Create model 
model <- nnet(Species ~ ., data = iris, size = 10, rang = 0.1, decay = 5e-4, maxit = 200)
# Predict
predicted <- predict(model, iris[,1:4], type = "class")
```

Sample Output format for r-nnet:

```R
# Output
[1] setosa setosa setosa setosa setosa setosa ...
Levels: setosa versicolor virginica
```

Command to run the R file:

If suppose the R code is saved in a file called `nnet_example.R` then the command to run the file would be:

```bash
Rscript nnet_example.R
```

This command is to be executed in the terminal. Rscript ensures that the R script file runs in the command line mode.
