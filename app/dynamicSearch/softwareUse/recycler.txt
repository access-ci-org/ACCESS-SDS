Use Case: Recycler is an algorithm for detecting plasmids from de novo assembly graphs. The application breaks graphs into subgraphs it predicts derive from plasmids.

Code details and examples:
Code:
Ensure the required files are in order.

Input files needed:
- Assembly graph in GFA format. 
- Reads in fastA format

Given these input files, you could run recycler using this command:

```bash
recycler.py -g your_graph.gfa -k 55 -o output_dir
```

In this case:
- `-g` specifies the input graph GFA file.
- `-k` is the kmer length that was used to assemble the input graph.
- `-o` specifies the output directory where Recycler will write its results.

Output files created:
- recycler.final.fasta: Contains circular contigs that Recycler has identified as putative plasmids.

Specifications on input file formatting:
GFA format - a tab-delimited text file describing the assembly graph. Each line describes either a node in the graph or an edge between nodes.
FastA format - a text-based format for representing either nucleotide sequences or amino acid (protein) sequences. Each sequence in FastA format begins with a single-line description, followed by lines of sequence data.

NOTE: For accurate results, input files should be correctly formatted and the data should be the appropriate data for the function.
