Use Case: RNAview is a popular software tool used extensively to determine secondary structure of RNA molecules from the 3D coordinate data in a PDB file. It reveals detailed base-pairing and base-stacking interactions in the structure, which are necessary for the function of RNA.

Code details and examples: 

Code:

To use RNAview, you will first need to format your input files correctly. The input to the RNAview program is a file in PDB format, that contains the 3D coordinates of the RNA molecule.

You will simply call the RNAview command followed by the filename of your PDB file, like so:

```bash
RNAbc -i example.pdb
```
In this case, 'example.pdb' is the PDB file containing the parameters for your specific RNA molecule. A pdb file is just a simple text file that contains the atom names and their positional coordinates of the RNA molecule.

The output of running RNAbc will be two files, one is 'example.pdb.out' file showing the base-pairing information in the RNA structure, and the other is 'example.pdb.psc' file for its postscript graphic output.

Note: The above provided code samples are much simplified for the purpose of this task. The actual implementation might need additional flags or parameters based on specific requirements.
