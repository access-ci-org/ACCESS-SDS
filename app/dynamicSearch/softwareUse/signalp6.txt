Use Case: SignalP is used for predicting signal peptide secretion in amino acid sequences i.e., it can be used for identifying secretory proteins. Input format for SignalP is a commonly used sequence format: FASTA.

Code Details and Examples:

Code:
```bash
signalp -fasta sample.fasta -org euk
```

Input Files: 

You need a .fasta file containing the sequences you wish to analyze. Here's an example of what the beginning of such a file might look like:

```fasta
>protein1
MKALIVLGLVLLSVTVQGKVFERCELARTLKRLGMDGYRGISLANWMCLAKWESGYNTRATNYNAGDRSTDYGIFQINS
>protein2
MKFLVFAVLFMVATLLAPFIPFFAFHAVEPRPNGNHAMHVPRMLQDLLFQATKPERRISDHERFPMMSTFKVLLCGAV
```
Specifications in the input file:

Each protein sequence in FASTA format begins with a single-line description, followed by lines of sequence data. The description line is distinguished from the sequence data by a greater-than (">") symbol in the first column. It is recommended that all lines of text be shorter than 80 characters in length. Sequences are expected to be represented in the standard IUB/IUPAC amino acid and nucleic acid codes.
