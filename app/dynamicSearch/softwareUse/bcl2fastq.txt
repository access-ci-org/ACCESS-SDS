Use Case: bcl2fastq is used to convert raw base call (BCL) data from Illumina sequencing systems into FASTQ file formats for downstream processing. It also demultiplexes data, splitting it up by sample based on a barcoding scheme.

Code Details and Examples:

Code:
```
bcl2fastq --input-dir ./RunFolder/Data/Intensities/BaseCalls \
  --output-dir ./RunFolder/Data/Intensities/BaseCalls/Unaligned \
  --sample-sheet ./RunFolder/Data/Intensities/BaseCalls/SampleSheet.csv \
  --barcode-mismatches 1
```
In the command, four parameters are set: the input directory (--input-dir), output directory (--output-dir), sample sheet (--sample-sheet) and barcode mismatches (--barcode-mismatches).

The input directory is where the base call files are located. The output directory is where the FASTQ files will be written to. The sample sheet file contains the sample information for demultiplexing the data. The barcode mismatches parameter determines how many mismatches are allowed in the barcode sequence during the demultiplexing process.

Additionally, SampleSheet.csv file format will be something like:

```
[Data]
Sample_ID,Sample_Name,Description,Index
Sample_1,Sample 1,Description 1,ATCG
Sample_2,Sample 2,Description 2,CATG
```
Each row after the [Data] line represents a single sample. Barcode sequences are provided in the Index column. Multiple barcodes for the same sample can be provided by adding additional rows with the same sample information.
