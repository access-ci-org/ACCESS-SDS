Use Case: Use Subversion for version control which allows easier version control, reverting to previous versions, and managing multiple branches of the codebase.

Sample Input File: A simple text file such as example.txt can be used to illustrate the subversion commands.

The file should have any text content, for example, it could be:
"Hello, World!

This is an example text file for Subversion."

The command to add this file to the Subversion repository is:

`svn add example.txt`

The command-line output will be:

```
A         example.txt
```

After adding the file, it needs to be committed to the repository:

`svn commit -m "Add example.txt" example.txt`

The command-line output will show the revision number, for example:

```
Adding         example.txt
Transmitting file data .
Committed revision 1.
```

When changes are made to the file, Subversion can show the differences:

`svn diff example.txt`

If the file was changed from "Hello, World!" to "Hello, World! This is Subversion.", then the command-line output will be something like:

```
Index: example.txt
===================================================================
--- example.txt	(revision 1)
+++ example.txt	(working copy)
@@ -1,2 +1,2 @@
-Hello, World!
+Hello, World! This is Subversion.
 
 This is an example text file for Subversion.
```

To update the file in the repository with the changes:

`svn commit -m "Update example.txt" example.txt`

The command-line output will be:

```
Sending        example.txt
Transmitting file data .
Committed revision 2.
```
