Use Case: Use biom-format for analysis, storing, and sharing of biological sample by sample data especially in metagenomics and marker-gene surveys.

Code details and examples:

Code:

Here are examples of using the biom-format package. We demonstrate creating a simple table, and accessing its metadata:

```python
from biom.table import Table
import numpy as np

# Prepare your data
data = np.array([[0, 1, 2], [3, 4, 5]])
sample_ids = ['sample_1', 'sample_2', 'sample_3']
observation_ids = ['observation_1', 'observation_2']
sample_metadata = [{'environment': 'A'}, {'environment': 'B'}, {'environment': 'A'}]
observation_metadata = [{'species': 's1'}, {'species': 's2'}]

# Create the table
table = Table(data, observation_ids, sample_ids, observation_metadata, sample_metadata)

# Accessing metadata
for value, id, metadata in table.iter(axis='sample'):
    print(f'Sample {id} is from environment {metadata["environment"]}')
```

Command to run: Simply use the python command to execute the script created with the code snippet above. For instance, if the code was saved in a file named "biom_example.py", use the following command:

```bash
python biom_example.py
```
