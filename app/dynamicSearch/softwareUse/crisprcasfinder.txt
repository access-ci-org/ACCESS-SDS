Use Case: This tool is used for identifying Cas protein and CRISPR arrays in the given nucleotide sequence.

Code details and examples:

Code:

Input Files: 

A FASTA file containing a sequence of nucleotides e.g `sequence.fasta`. The file format should be as per the FASTA specification with each sequence beginning with a '>' sign immediately followed by the ID of the sequence and on the next lines the actual sequence as:
```
>sequence_id
ATGCACACGA....
```

Command to run it: 

It is typically run on a command line as with the following command:
```
perl casfinder.pl -in sequence.fasta -out results -cas -def S -so
```
In this command, `-in` specifies the input file (seq.fasta), `-out` outlines the results, `-cas` triggers CASFinder, `-def` is for defining cas subtype and `-so` sorts the sequences in the output files. 

Output will be stored in the `results` directory. The `CASFinder-Result.txt` is the main result file. It contains details about identified CRISPR arrays and their corresponding encoded Cas protein within the input sequences.

Specifications and Details in input files:

The input sequence must be DNA and not protein. The tool takes as input a single or multiple DNA sequence(s) in FASTA format (`*.fasta` or `*.fa`). The sequences must be ranged from 400 to 560 000 nucleotides. Sequences longer than 560 000 nt are also processed but by segments of maximum 560 000 nt. 

The identifier of each sequence in the input file must be unique (1st line starting with '>'). If the sequence identifier already exists in the `userJobID` directory, the sequence will not be treated.
