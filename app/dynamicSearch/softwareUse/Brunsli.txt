For decompression process, your input file should be in .jbr format which is output of Brunsli compression. For example, let's take an input file as "efg.jbr"

Command to decompress:
```
brunsli efg.jbr > efg.jpg
```
This command outputs a .jpg file after decompressing the .jbr file.

For compression process, the input should be an original uncompressed .jpg image file. For Example, let's take an input file as "abc.jpg" 

Command to compress:

```
This command creates a .jbr file which is compressed form of original .jpg file.
