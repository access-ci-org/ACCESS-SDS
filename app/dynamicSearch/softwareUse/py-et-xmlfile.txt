Use Case: Use for creating large XML files in Python. A Python library to create XML using an excel like manner, it creates large XML reports quickly.

Code details and examples: Code.

Sample Input File: It could be a large dataset which users want to convert to XML.

Format Required: Usually, a dataframe format or tabular format would work best. This gets converted into XML.

Specifications and details in input files: The input data needs to be in rows and columns format, where each column is an attribute and each row is a data entity.

Code Snippet:
```python
from et_xmlfile import xmlfile, XMLWriter

def create_large_xml(filename):
    with xmlfile(filename) as xf:
        with xf.element('root'):
            writer = XMLWriter(xf)
            for i in range(50000):
                writer.start('item')
                writer.element('field1', 'Data1')
                writer.element('field2', 'Data2')
                writer.element('fieldn', 'Datan')
                writer.end('item')
create_large_xml('large.xml')
```

In this code, the function `create_large_xml()` creates an XML file named 'large.xml', and for that, it uses the `XMLWriter()` function from the 'et_xmlfile' library in a loop for generating 50000 'item' elements each having multiple 'field' subelements.

Command to run the code: This is a Python script, and can be executed from the command line with: `python script.py`. 'script.py' should be replaced with the actual filename of the script.
