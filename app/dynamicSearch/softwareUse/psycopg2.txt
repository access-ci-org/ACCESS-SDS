Use Case: Use psycopg2 to connect to a PostgreSQL database, execute SQL queries and fetch results.

Code details and examples: Code 

1. Import the library:

    ```python
    import psycopg2
    ```

2. Establish a connection:

    ```python
    connection = psycopg2.connect(
        database="your_database",
        user="your_username",
        password="your_password",
        host="127.0.0.1",
        port="5432"
    )
    ```

    Note: Replace "your_database",  "your_username", "your_password", "host" and "port" with your PostgreSQL database details.

3. Create a cursor object:

    ```python
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    ```

4. Execute a SQL query:

    ```python
    cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM your_table")
    ```

    Note: Replace "your_table" with the name of your table.

5. Fetch all rows:

    ```python
    rows = cursor.fetchall()
    ``` 

6. Close the cursor and the connection:

    ```python
    cursor.close()
    connection.close()
    ```

Command to run the entire Python code:

    ```sh
    python your_file.py
    ```

Note: Replace "your_file.py" with the name of your Python file.

File requirements: No specific input files are required to run psycopg2. The inputs are taken from the connected PostgreSQL database.
