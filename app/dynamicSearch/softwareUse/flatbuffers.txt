Use Case: FlatBuffers is a tool used for serializing and deserializing structured data in a manner that is highly efficient both in terms of speed and memory footprint. It is often used in game development and communication protocols to minimize overhead.

Code Details and Examples: 
Code:

The following code exemplifies how to create a FlatBuffer (.in a new file monster.fbs):

```c++
namespace MyGame.Sample;

enum Color:byte { Red = 0, Green, Blue = 2 }

union Equipment { Weapon, Armor } // Optionally add more tables.

struct Vec3 {
  x:float;
  y:float;
  z:float;
}

table Monster {
  pos:Vec3;
  mana:short = 150;
  hp:short = 100;
  name:string;
  friendly:bool = false (deprecated, remove);
  inventory:[ubyte]; 
  color:Color = Blue; 
  weapons:[Weapon];
  equipped:Equipment;
}

root_type Monster;
```
In above code, a union is defined and tables and structs are present. Once defined, you can build it using the following command:
```bash
./flatc -c -b monster.fbs
```
This command will generate both a binary file and C++ headers that you can include in your project.

Now, you can create a buffer in your application like so:

```c++
flatbuffers::FlatBufferBuilder builder;

auto weapon_one_name = builder.CreateString("Sword");
short weapon_one_damage = 3;
auto weapon_two_name = builder.CreateString("Axe");
short weapon_two_damage = 5;

// Use the `CreateWeapon` shortcut to create Weapons with all fields set.
auto sword = CreateWeapon(builder, weapon_one_name, weapon_one_damage);
auto axe = CreateWeapon(builder, weapon_two_name, weapon_two_damage);

// Create a `vector` representing the inventory of the Orc. Each number
// could correspond to an item that can be claimed after he is slain.
std::vector<uint8_t> inventory { 3, 7, 1 };

...

// Deserialize to verify it worked
auto monster = GetMonster(builder.GetBufferPointer());
```
This example shows you how to create a `Weapon` table, build a vector, and reverse the endianness of the serialized data.
