Use Case: NCL (NCAR Command Language) is a language designed specifically for scientific data analysis and visualization, particularly suitable for working with large netCDF, HDF, GRIB, and other dataset files.

Code details and examples: 

Code:

```
; Load the necessary libraries
load "$NCARG_ROOT/lib/ncarg/nclscripts/csm/gsn_code.ncl"
load "$NCARG_ROOT/lib/ncarg/nclscripts/csm/gsn_csm.ncl"

; Start a graphics workstation
wks = gsn_open_wks("png","plot")

; Define a variable
data = addfile("data.nc","r")

; Define a data variable from the file
var = data->temperature(0,:,:)

; Create a contour plot of the variable
plot = gsn_csm_contour_map(wks,var,False)

; Draw the plot
draw(plot)
end
```
This example reads a netCDF file named 'data.nc', selects the 'temperature' variable from the file, generates a contour map of the variable, and outputs the plot to a 'png' image file named 'plot'. 

The input file should be a netCDF file that contains a 'temperature' variable. 

To run this script, save it as a '.ncl' file and run the 'ncl' command followed by the file name. For example, if the file is named script.ncl, you would run:

```
ncl script.ncl
```

This will generate a new PNG image file named 'plot' in the same directory.
