Use Case: libreadline is used for providing line input editing and history features, typically used in command-line user interfaces and shell programs. It also allows users to move the cursor, search in the history, or kill the line or part of it. 

Code details and examples: 

Code:

The following is an example of a C code that reads a line from the console using libreadline:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <readline/readline.h>
#include <readline/history.h>

int main()
{
    char *line;

    line = readline("Enter text: ");
    if(line == NULL) {
        printf("No input entered.\n");
        return -1;
    }

    add_history(line);

    printf("You entered: '%s'\n", line);

    free(line);

    return 0;
}
```
The command to compile and run this code:
 
gcc readline_example.c -lreadline -o readline_example
./readline_example

Here, "-lreadline" tells GCC to link the readline library with your program, and "-o" specifies the name of the output file. readline_example is the name of the binary after itâ€™s been compiled.

The input needed for this program: Any text user wants to enter. After running the program, it will ask "Enter text: ", then user needs to enter the input and press enter.

For example, if user enters "Hello World", the program will return "You entered: 'Hello World'".
