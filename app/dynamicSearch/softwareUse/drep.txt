Use Case: dRep is a python program that rapidly compares large sets of genomes. It uses Mash and ANImf to calculate genome distances, performs a greedy clustering algorithm, and uses the scores to pick the best genome.

Code Details and Examples:

Code: 

For dRep compare, you are required to have an output directory and a list of genome files.
Every genome needs to be a single .fasta or .fa file. 

Code for dRep:
```
dRep compare output_directory -g genome_list.txt
```

Example 'genome_list.txt' file:
```
/home/user/genomes/genome1.fna
/home/user/genomes/genome2.fna
/home/user/genomes/genome3.fna
```

Run the command:
```
dRep compare ./dRep_comparison -g ./genome_list.txt
```

This command runs the comparison feature of dRep on the genomes listed in the genome_list.txt and stores the result in the directory 'dRep_comparison'.
