Use Case: 
MaSuRCA is a bioinformatics software package used for genome assembly. It can assemble data sets containing only short reads from Illumina sequencing and data sets with a mixture of data types. 

Code details and examples: 

Input Files: 

1. PE (Paired-End library)
   For an Illumina paired-end library, at least one group must be defined. 
   Example of command and input file:
   ```
   DATA
   PE= pe 300 150 /path_to_file/lib_name.R1.fq /path_to_file/lib_name.R2.fq
   END
   ```
   Each line provides information about the insert size (300 in this case), insert size standard deviation (150 in this case), and the paths to the paired fastq files.

2. JUMP (Long-Jumping library)
    For long-jump libraries, a group must be defined.
    Example of command and input file:
    ```
    DATA
    JUMP= jump 8000 2000 /path_to_file/lib_name.R1.fq /path_to_file/lib_name.R2.fq
    END
    ```
   Each line provides information about the insert size (8000 in this case), insert size standard deviation (2000 in this case), and the paths to the paired fastq files.

3. Pacbio or Nanopore reads
   If Pacbio or Nanopore reads are available, they can be used.
   Example of command and input file:
   ```
   DATA
   PACBIO=/path_to_file/pacbio_reads.fa
   NANOPORE=/path_to_file/nanopore_reads.fa
   END
   ```
   Each path should be to a file containing all SMRT cells of data.

Command to run:

Once configuration file is ready we can run the assembler with the following command:

   ```
   assemble.sh configuration.txt
   ```
This will generate the desired output files.
