Use Case: RAPIDS is a suite of open-source software libraries for executing end-to-end data science and analytics pipelines entirely on GPUs. It provides a simple API for GPU-accelerated data analytics and machine learning.

Code details and examples:

Code:

```python
import cudf, io, requests
from io import StringIO

# Downloading the dataset
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/plotly/datasets/master/tips.csv"
content = requests.get(url).content.decode('utf-8')

# Reading it into a GPU DataFrame
tips_df = cudf.read_csv(StringIO(content))
tips_df['tip_percentage'] = tips_df['tip']/tips_df['total_bill']*100

# Group and sort by day and smoker
print(tips_df.groupby(['day', 'smoker']).tip_percentage.mean())
```

Input files & format: Input data can be a variety of file formats (CSV, JSON, Parquet etc.) but here we are using CSV. This URL based CSV file contains a dataset about restaurant tips.

Specifications and details in input files: No specific details are needed in CSV. Normal dataset with columns such as ['day', 'smoker', 'tip', 'total_bill'] would work fine for above code. 

Command to run: 

If the code is written in a script file(.py file), it can be run using:
```bash
python filename.py
```
If the code is written in a Jupyter notebook cell, the cell can simply be run using Shift+Enter. 

Make sure you have installed the necessary RAPIDS libraries like cudf beforehand (which is not part of the question though).
