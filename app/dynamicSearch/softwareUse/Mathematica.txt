Use Case: Mathematica can be used to process complex mathematical equations and algorithms. For instance, a scientist may want to solve a differential equation using Mathematica. 

Code details and examples: 

Code: 
```mathematica
(*Define the differential equation*)
eq = y'[x] == y[x] Cos[x + y[x]];

(*Define the initial condition*)
ic = y[0] == 1;

(*Solve the differential equation*)
sol = NDSolve[{eq, ic}, y, {x, 0, 30}][[1]]

(*Plot the solution*)
Plot[Evaluate[y[x] /. sol], {x, 0, 30}, 
 PlotRange -> All, 
 PlotLabel -> "Solution of the differential equation"]
```

In this example input file the differential equation y'=y Cos[x+y], with the initial condition y(0)=1, is being solved. This file is in plain text format. It is creating a solution for values of x from 0 to 30. 

Simply save the above code in a Mathematica notebook or plaintext file with '.m' extension, then it can be run via command line using the following command inside a Mathematica kernel:
```
MathematicaScript -script yourfile.m
```
