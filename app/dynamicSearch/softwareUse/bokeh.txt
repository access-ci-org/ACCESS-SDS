Use Case: Bokeh is used for creating interactive visualizations for modern web browsers. It provides elegant, concise construction of versatile graphics, and affords high-performance interactivity over large or streaming datasets.

Code Details and Examples: Code 

In Bokeh, data is provided for plotting using Python lists, arrays, or pandas objects. Consider a simple excel data file ("data.xlsx") containing 2 columns- 'Fruits' and 'Quantity'. 

Sample input file format:
 
     Fruits   Quantity
 0   Apples   25
 1   Oranges  18
 2   Bananas  22 

Here is a simple example of using Bokeh to display this data as a plot:

```python
from bokeh.plotting import figure, show
from bokeh.io import output_file
import pandas as pd

# Load data
df = pd.read_excel("data.xlsx")

f = figure(x_range=df['Fruits'], plot_width=400, plot_height=400)

f.vbar(x=df['Fruits'], width=0.5, bottom=0, top=df['Quantity'], color="firebrick")

output_file("barchart.html")

show(f)
```

Command to run: 

You can run the Python code above through a Python interpreter or Jupyter notebook. To run the python script from command line, navigate to the directory where the script is saved and use the command:

```bash
python filename.py
```

In the mentioned code, `'Fruits'` is on X-axis and `'Quantity'` is on Y-axis. A vertical bar (vbar) chart is used to represent the given data. The output is saved as an HTML file "barchart.html" and can be viewed in web browser.

Please ensure Bokeh is properly imported and data file is present in your working directory for successful execution.
