Use Case: LIBVORI is a high-performance library for Voronoi integration on arbitrary 3D grids. It is utilized in the context of computational quantum chemistry to determine atomic volumes and charges from electronic densities;

Code details and examples: Code

LIBVORI doesn't provide explicit command line interfaces and it is not designed to be used as stand-alone software. It must be linked together with a quantum chemistry package which uses it to post-process electronic densities. Hence, a generic usage would be to call its routines in another program. Here's a very generalized example in a quantum chemistry program:

``` C++
// include libvori header files
#include "v_container.h"
#include "v_fun.h"
#include "v_file.h"

// ... modify according to your quantum chemistry code and create objects

for (unsigned int atomNr=0;atomNr<atomList.size();++atomNr){
// integrate around the atom and get the volume
double atomVolume=v_total_vol(&atomList[atomNr],grid);
// print it out
cout << "Volume of Voronoi cell " << atomNr << " : " << atomVolume << endl;
}
```
This example will compute Voronoi volumes for all atoms in a list. Required data structure includes grid representation of electron density and atomic position coordinates. Specifics of input format will vary greatly depending on the overarching software package the library will be linked with.
