Use Case: Use libxml2 to parse XML documents in Python.

Code details and examples: Code 

libxml2 is an XML C parser and toolkit developed for the Gnome project. It is implemented in a set of libraries enabling to parse, manipulate and generate XML documents. Here is an example of how you can use it in Python.

1. Python Sample code to use libxml2:

    ```
    import libxml2

    doc = libxml2.parseFile("sample.xml")
    ctxt = doc.xpathNewContext()
    res = ctxt.xpathEval("//*[local-name()='elem']")
    ```

The `parseFile` function is used to parse the XML file which is "sample.xml" in this case.

2. The sample.xml could look like:

    ```
    <?xml version="1.0"?>
    <!-- Comment -->
    <!DOCTYPE root [
      <!ELEMENT root ANY>
      <!ENTITY h "Hello, out there ">
    ]>
    <root>
      <elem attr='99'>
        <subelem>Some text.</subelem>
        <subelem>Some more text.</subelem>
      </elem>
      <elem attr='37'>
        <subelem>Even more text.</subelem>
        <subelem>Yet even more text.</subelem>
      </elem>
    </root>
    ```

3. To run the python code, save it in a file named `sample.py` and run `python sample.py`.

Specifications: libxml2-python provides Python bindings for the libxml2 XML parser library. It is compatible with Python versions 2.7 and 3.x. XML file used as input should be well-formed, and it does not require any specific software or hardware specifications. 

Please note that the above-given example takes a XML file as input, parse it and find any element with local name "elem". The specific query depends on the XML structure and requirements.
