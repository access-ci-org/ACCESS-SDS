Use Case: Use util-macros to facilitate the writing of Autoconf scripts for X.org modules. It provides several m4 macros and various shell scripts for common tasks that can be re-used across multiple packages.

Code details and examples: Code

The input file would be a configuration script that utilizes the m4 macros provided by the util-macros package. For instance:

```
AC_PREREQ([2.60])
AC_INIT([FULL-PACKAGE-NAME], [VERSION], [BUG-REPORT-ADDRESS])
AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE([1.9 foreign no-dist-gzip dist-bzip2])
AM_MAINTAINER_MODE

XORG_DEFAULT_OPTIONS

AC_CONFIG_FILES([
Makefile
src/Makefile
])
AC_OUTPUT
```

This script is written in the m4 macro language and will utilize macros provided by both Autoconf (`AC_PREREQ`, `AC_INIT`, etc.) and util-macros (`XORG_DEFAULT_OPTIONS`). The script can be written in any text editor and does not need to adhere to any particular file format.

You would then run Autoconf to generate a 'configure' script:

`autoconf`

Then call your newly-generated script:

`./configure`

This will prepare your application's source code so that it can be built and installed on the user's system.
