Use Case: htop is an interactive system-monitor process viewer. It is designed as an alternative to the Unix program top. It shows a frequently updated list of the processes running on a computer, sorted by the CPU usage.

Code details and examples:

Code:

There is no need for input files or code snippets for htop, as it is a command-line tool that provides real-time monitoring. You simply launch it in the terminal using the command:

```bash
htop
```

Once htop is running, you can use your keyboard for various operations:
- Arrows, PgUP, PgDn, Home, End: Scroll the process list.
- Space: Tag or untag a process. Commands that can operate on multiple processes, like "kill", will then apply over the tagged processes, instead of the currently highlighted one.
- U: Untag all processes (removes all tags added with the space key).
- s: Trace process system calls (strace).
- l: Display open files for a process (lsof).
- u: Show only processes owned by a specified user.
- H: Hide threads: if checked, all individual threads will be hidden and only process "groups" recognized by the kernel become visible.
- K: Hide kernel threads: prevents the threads belonging the kernel to be displayed in the process list. (This is beyond the ones displaying as kthreadd and ksoftirq in Turquoise.)

Output:

htop generates a live output in the terminal, showing an overview of CPU and memory usage, as well as a detailed list of running processes. This output is interactive and can be controlled using various keys.
