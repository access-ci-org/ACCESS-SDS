Use Case: Use sklearn for classification with logistic regression.
Code details and examples: 

Code:
```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
import pandas as pd

# Load iris dataset
iris = load_iris()

X = iris.data
y = iris.target

# Split the data
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Logistic Regression
clf = LogisticRegression(random_state=42).fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predictions
predictions = clf.predict(X_test)

# Print prediction
print(y_test)
print(predictions)
```

This code snippet will go fetch the Iris dataset. No other file inputs are required. The Iris dataset includes four features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width) of 150 iris samples of three different species.

Command to run:
If you have the code in a python file, you can simply run `python your_file_name.py` in the command line to execute the code.
