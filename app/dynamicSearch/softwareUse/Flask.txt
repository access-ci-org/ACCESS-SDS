Use Case: Build a simple web app to display 'Hello, World!'

Code details and examples: Code:

You will need a python file (app.py) with the following content:

```python
from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def hello_world():
    return 'Hello, World!'

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

This simple Flask app has one route ('/') that returns 'Hello, World!' when accessed. 

Command to run this Flask app:

1. Set the FLASK_APP environment variable to the name of your python file. This can be done using the command:
   ```shell
   export FLASK_APP=app.py
   ```
2. Run your app with the command:
   ```shell
   flask run
   ```
When you access the domain (typically http://127.0.0.1:5000/ for local development) on a web browser, 'Hello, World!' should be displayed.

Use Case: Implement URL Routes

Code details and examples: Code:

Flask lets you use route parameters. Here's how to create a user profile page.

```python
@app.route('/user/<username>')
def show_user_profile(username):
    # Show the user profile for that user
    return 'User %s' % escape(username)
```
The '<username>' part of the URL is dynamic.
