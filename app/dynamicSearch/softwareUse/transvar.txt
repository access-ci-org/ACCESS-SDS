Use Case: TransVar is a useful bioinformatics tool utilized for the annotation and impact prediction of genetic variants. It's especially helpful in decoding genomic locations for the specified variants using reference genome features.

Code details and examples:

TransVar requires a colon-separated .txt file containing variant descriptions in a gDNA:cDNA:p.[mutant] format.

Sample input file (input.txt):

```
g.chr7:140453136A>T
```

Basic use with command line:

```bash
transvar canno -i 'chr7:g.140453134A>T' --ccds
```

In terms of Python integration, it's feasible but requires careful implementation as the tool was originally designed for utilization within a UNIX command line. Here's a sample snippet to help get the job done:

```python
import subprocess

# Define our variant as well as the path to the TransVar executable
variant = 'chr7:g.140453134A>T'
transvar_path = '/path/to/transvar'

# Use subprocess to call TransVar with our variant
result = subprocess.run([transvar_path, 'canno', '-i', variant, '--ccds'], stdout=subprocess.PIPE)

# Print the output
print(result.stdout.decode('utf-8'))
```

This shell command queries the CCDS database for the HGVS gDNA description 'chr7:g.140453134A>T' and returns its corresponding CCDS annotations. The python code does the same and provides output to the terminal.
