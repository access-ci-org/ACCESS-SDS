    "comprehensive_overview": "QCA (Qualitative Comparative Analysis) is a comparative analytical method primarily used in the social sciences to analyze data sets involving categorical variables. It is a method for studying the relationships between the presence and absence of conditions and an outcome of interest.",
    "core_features": "1. Boolean minimization: QCA uses Boolean algebra to reduce complex data sets into simpler forms for analysis.\n2. Truth tables and logical operations: It generates truth tables to represent the relationships between variables and performs logical operations on them.\n3. Consistency and coverage analysis: QCA evaluates the consistency and coverage of configurations of conditions related to outcomes.\n4. Calibration and fuzzy set analysis: It allows for fuzzy set analysis to account for cases where conditions are not strictly present or absent.\n5. Interpretation and visualization: QCA provides tools for interpreting results and visualizing complex relationships between variables.",
