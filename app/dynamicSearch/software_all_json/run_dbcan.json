    "comprehensive_overview": "run_dbcan is a computational pipeline for the automatic annotation of carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes) from metagenomic data. It integrates various tools and databases to predict CAZymes and classify them into different families based on sequence homology and conserved protein domains.",
    "core_features": "1. Automatic annotation of CAZymes from metagenomic data\n2. Integration of multiple tools and databases for prediction and classification of CAZymes\n3. Classification of CAZymes into different families based on sequence homology and conserved domains\n4. User-friendly interface for running the pipeline and obtaining annotation results\n5. Customization options for adjusting parameters and databases for annotation",
