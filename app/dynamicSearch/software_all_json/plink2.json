  "software_name": "plink2",
  "comprehensive_overview": "PLINK is a free, open-source whole genome association analysis toolset, designed to perform a range of basic, large-scale analyses in a computationally efficient manner. The focus of PLINK is purely on analysis of genotype/phenotype data, so there is no support for steps prior to this (e.g. study design and planning, generating genotype or CNV calls from raw data).",
  "core_features": "1. Quality control of genotype data\n2. Data management\n3. Powerful association analysis methods\n4. Population stratification analysis\n5. LD-based clumping procedures\n6. Support for quantitative phenotypes\n7. Support for gene-gene interaction testing",
