  "software_name": "py-numexpr",
  "comprehensive_overview": "Numexpr is a fast numerical expression evaluator for NumPy. With it, expressions that operate on arrays (like 3*A+4*B) are accelerated and use less memory than doing the same calculation in Python.",
  "core_features": "1. Fast evaluation of array expressions\n2. Use of less memory during calculations\n3. Built for NumPy arrays\n4. Supports multi-threading for parallel computation\n5. Integration with other numerical libraries like SciPy",
