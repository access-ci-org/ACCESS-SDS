  "software_name": "scvelo",
  "comprehensive_overview": "scvelo is a Python package for the analysis and interpretation of dynamical systems measured in single-cell genomics data. It provides a toolkit for studying and understanding the dynamical nature of cell differentiation processes.",
  "core_features": "1. Trajectory inference and visualization for single-cell genomics data. 2. Velocity estimation to determine the direction and speed of gene expression changes in individual cells. 3. Reconstruction of RNA velocity field to infer cell state transitions and developmental trajectories. 4. Tools for exploring and plotting RNA velocity dynamics in single-cell data.",
