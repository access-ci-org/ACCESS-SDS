    "comprehensive_overview": "FastTree is a tool for inferring approximately-maximum-likelihood phylogenetic trees from alignments of nucleotide or protein sequences. FastTree can handle alignments with up to a few thousand sequences and has been designed to make trees with the minimum scale up to 100,000 sequences faster by approximating maximum-likelihood with heuristics.",
