    "software_name": "SuperLU_DIST",
    "comprehensive_overview": "SuperLU_DIST is a parallel, distributed-memory sparse direct solver for large linear systems with multiple right-hand sides. It is designed for distributed-memory parallel computers and utilizes partial pivoting with static pivoting thresholds. This software package provides a highly parallel sparse direct solver that performs matrix factorization and triangular solution stages efficiently on large-scale parallel machines.",
