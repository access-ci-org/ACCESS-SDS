  "comprehensive_overview": "The Amsterdam Modeling Suite (AMS) offers a comprehensive set of programs for computational chemistry. One of the key components is the Atomistix ToolKit (ATK) for quantum mechanical and classical atomistic simulations of materials.",
  "core_features": "ATK enables simulations based on density functional theory (DFT) for electronic structure calculations, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations for atomistic modeling, and a combination of both in quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) approaches. It supports a wide range of materials properties and advanced analysis tools.",
