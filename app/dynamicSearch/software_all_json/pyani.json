  "software_name": "pyani",
  "comprehensive_overview": "pyani is a Python module that calculates average nucleotide identity (ANI) and related measures for whole genome comparisons. It is a tool used to compare microbial genomes to determine genetic relatedness and evolutionary distances.",
  "core_features": "1. Calculation of Average Nucleotide Identity (ANI) for whole genome comparisons.\n2. Utilizes the JSpecies suite to perform ANI calculations efficiently.\n3. Supports multiple input formats including FASTA, Genbank, and multi-FASTA files.\n4. Provides options for parallelization to speed up the computation process.\n5. Generates output in various formats for easy interpretation and downstream analysis.",
