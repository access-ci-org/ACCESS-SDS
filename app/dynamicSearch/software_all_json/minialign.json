    "software_name": "minialign",
    "comprehensive_overview": "minialign is an ultrafast, memory efficient, and highly accurate tool for multiple sequence alignment (MSA) of biological sequences. It is designed to handle very large datasets with high throughput. The software employs a k-mer based approach for rapid pairwise alignment followed by progressive alignment to generate the final MSA.",
