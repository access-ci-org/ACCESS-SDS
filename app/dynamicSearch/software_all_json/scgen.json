    "comprehensive_overview": "scGen is a deep learning framework for generating bulk-level transcriptomic profiles from single-cell RNA-sequencing data. It predicts the influence of genetic and environmental factors on gene expression at a population-level, bridging the resolution gap between single-cell and bulk-level omics data.",
