    "comprehensive_overview": "SHAPEIT4 is a fast and accurate method for haplotype phasing based on a haplotype model similar to that used in SHAPEIT2. It adopts a new exact fragment inference algorithm that scales linearly with the effective number of haplotypes, making it highly efficient for large cohorts. SHAPEIT4 also includes a novel model that captures long-range phasing information through a conditional random field.",
