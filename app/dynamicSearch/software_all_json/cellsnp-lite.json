    "software_name": "cellsnp-lite",
    "comprehensive_overview": "Cellsnp-lite is a variant calling tool for single-cell RNA sequencing data, specifically designed for genotyping and haplotype inference for diploid cells. It allows for accurately detecting single-nucleotide variations, small insertions and deletions, and single-cell genotyping from scRNA-seq data.",
    "core_features": "1. Genotyping of single cells\n2. Haplotype inference for diploid cells\n3. Detection of single-nucleotide variations (SNVs) and small indels\n4. Single-cell RNA sequencing data analysis\n5. High accuracy in variant calling",
