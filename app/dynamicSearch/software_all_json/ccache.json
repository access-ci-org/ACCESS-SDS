  "software_name": "ccache",
  "comprehensive_overview": "ccache is a compiler cache tool designed to speed up C and C++ compilation by caching previous compilations. It acts as a caching proxy for compilers, storing compiled object files in a cache directory, which can be reused when the same compilation is done again. This reduces compilation times significantly, especially during iterative development processes.",
  "core_features": [
    "Caching compiled object files for faster compilation times",
    "Transparently intercepting compiler calls",
    "Support for various compilers and build systems",
    "Customizable cache size and behavior",
