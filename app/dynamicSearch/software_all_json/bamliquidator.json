  "software_name": "bamliquidator",
  "comprehensive_overview": "bamliquidator is a tool for finding biologically-relevant peak sets in high-throughput sequencing data, particularly ChIP-seq and ATAC-seq data. It helps in identifying enriched regions (peaks) by calculating the fold enrichment compared to control data.",
  "core_features": "1. Identifying enriched regions (peaks) in ChIP-seq and ATAC-seq data\n2. Calculating fold enrichment compared to control data\n3. Generating statistics and visualization of peak sets\n4. Providing options for customization and integration with downstream analysis tools",
