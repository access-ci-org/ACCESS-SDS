    "comprehensive_overview": "TransDecoder identifies candidate coding regions within transcript sequences, such as those generated by de novo RNA-Seq transcript assembly using Trinity, or other full-length RNA-Seq datasets. It combines homology searches with open reading frame (ORF) detection to predict likely coding regions.",
