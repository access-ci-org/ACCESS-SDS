    "comprehensive_overview": "Numexpr is a fast numerical expression evaluator for NumPy. With it, expressions that operate on arrays (like '3*a+4*b') are accelerated and use less memory than doing the same calculation in Python. In addition, its multi-threaded capabilities can make use of all your cores in a CPU.",
