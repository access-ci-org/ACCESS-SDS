    "comprehensive_overview": "TPMCalculator is a computational tool that enables the quantification of gene expression levels from RNA-Seq data based on the transcripts per million (TPM) method. TPM calculations normalize read counts by the length of the transcripts and the total number of mapped reads, providing a more accurate representation of gene expression levels.",
