    "comprehensive_overview": "Numba is a just-in-time compiler for Python that works best on code that uses NumPy arrays and functions. It compiles Python functions to machine code at runtime using the industry-standard LLVM compiler library. It is designed to be used with NumPy arrays and functions, and integrates seamlessly with the Python scientific software stack.",
