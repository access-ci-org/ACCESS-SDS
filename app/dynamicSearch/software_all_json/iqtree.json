    "comprehensive_overview": "IQ-TREE is a fast and effective software for phylogenomic inference. It implements a variety of models for DNA and protein sequences, including substitution models, rate heterogeneity, and mixture models. IQ-TREE uses maximum likelihood estimation to construct phylogenetic trees, and offers ultrafast bootstrap approximation to assess the tree accuracy.",
