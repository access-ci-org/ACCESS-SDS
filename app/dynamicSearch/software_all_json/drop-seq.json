    "comprehensive_overview": "Drop-seq is a computational method that enables biologists to analyze the gene expression profiles of thousands of individual cells in a single experiment. It is designed to perform single-cell RNA sequencing using microfluidic techniques.",
    "core_features": "1. Enables analysis of gene expression profiles at the single-cell level\n2. Utilizes microfluidic techniques for high-throughput single-cell RNA sequencing\n3. Allows for the identification of cell types and characterization of cell populations within heterogeneous samples\n4. Provides a platform for studying gene expression dynamics in individual cells\n5. Facilitates the discovery of rare cell types and transitional cell states",
