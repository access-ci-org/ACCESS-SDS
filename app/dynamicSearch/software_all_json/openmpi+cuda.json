    "comprehensive_overview": "OpenMPI is an open-source Message Passing Interface (MPI) library that allows for parallel computing on a distributed memory system. CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture) is a parallel computing platform and programming model developed by NVIDIA for their GPUs. When used together, OpenMPI and CUDA enable high-performance parallel computing on GPU-accelerated clusters.",
