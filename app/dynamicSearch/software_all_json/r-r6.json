    "software_name": "R6",
    "comprehensive_overview": "R6 is an object-oriented programming system in R that allows for the creation of reference classes. It provides a way to define classes with reference semantics, similar to traditional object-oriented programming languages such as Java or C++. Reference classes allow for mutable objects and methods that can modify object state.",
