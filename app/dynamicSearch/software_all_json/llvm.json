    "comprehensive_overview": "The LLVM Project is a collection of modular and reusable compiler and toolchain technologies. LLVM is used for developing compiler back-ends, static analysis tools, and JIT compilation engines.",
    "core_features": "LLVM provides a modern code generation infrastructure with a strong focus on compile-time, run-time, and language-agnostic components. It includes a wide range of compiler technologies, such as front-end parsing, optimization passes, and code generation. LLVM also offers a powerful intermediate representation (IR) that facilitates optimization and portability across different architectures.",
