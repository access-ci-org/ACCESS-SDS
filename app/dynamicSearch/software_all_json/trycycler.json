  "software_name": "trycycler",
  "comprehensive_overview": "Trycycler is a software tool designed for the analysis of highly divergent microbial genomes, specifically those with atypical genome structures or high levels of genetic variation. It aims to accurately identify and assemble circular contigs from metagenomic datasets, which can be particularly challenging due to the presence of repeats, inversions, and other complex genome rearrangements.",
