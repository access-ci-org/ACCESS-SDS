  "comprehensive_overview": "Zstandard (or zstd) is a fast data compression algorithm developed by Facebook. It is designed to provide high compression ratios with very low latency, making it suitable for real-time compression/decompression scenarios. Zstandard offers a wide range of compression levels, from very fast to very strong, allowing users to balance between speed and compression ratio based on their requirements.",
