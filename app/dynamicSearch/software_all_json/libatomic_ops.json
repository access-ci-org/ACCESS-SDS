    "software_name": "libatomic_ops",
    "comprehensive_overview": "Libatomic_ops is a library implementing atomic memory access operations for use in concurrent programming. It provides a number of low-level memory access and synchronization operations which can be used in lock-free data structures and for inter-thread communication without the need for locks.",
    "core_features": "1. Provides atomic operations for memory access.\n2. Facilitates concurrent programming and lock-free data structures.\n3. Enables inter-thread communication without locks.\n4. Supports a wide range of platforms and compilers.",
