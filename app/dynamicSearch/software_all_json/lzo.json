    "comprehensive_overview": "Lempel-Ziv-Oberhumer (LZO) is a data compression algorithm that focuses on high-speed compression and decompression. It offers fast compression and decompression speeds with moderate compression ratios. LZO is commonly used in applications where speed is more critical than achieving the highest compression ratios.",
