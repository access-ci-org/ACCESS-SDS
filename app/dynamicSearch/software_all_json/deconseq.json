  "software_name": "DeconSeq",
  "comprehensive_overview": "DeconSeq is a novel program specifically designed to automatically decontaminate sequences and detect possible contamination in sequence datasets. It efficiently detects and removes sequence contamination from high-throughput sequencing reads. The tool is particularly useful in metagenomics studies to ensure the quality and accuracy of the analysis results.",
  "core_features": "1. Removal of contaminating sequences from datasets\n2. Detection of contamination based on user-defined criteria\n3. Support for various sequence formats\n4. Customizable parameters for tailored analysis\n5. Efficient processing of high-throughput sequencing data",
