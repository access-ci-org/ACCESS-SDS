  "software_name": "brotli",
  "comprehensive_overview": "Brotli is a generic-purpose lossless compression algorithm that compresses data using a combination of a modern variant of the LZ77 algorithm, Huffman coding, and 2nd order context modelling. It is developed by Google and designed to replace the zlib compression.",
  "core_features": "1. High compression ratio: Brotli provides better compression ratios compared to the existing compression algorithms. 2. Fast decompression speed: Brotli decompression is highly efficient, making it suitable for use in various applications. 3. Support for multiple platforms: Brotli is available for various platforms including desktop and mobile environments. 4. Open-source: Brotli is an open-source project, allowing for community contributions and improvements. 5. Integration with web browsers: Brotli is supported by major web browsers, enabling faster loading times for web pages.",
