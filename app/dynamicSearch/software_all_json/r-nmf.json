  "comprehensive_overview": "R-NMF is an R package for performing Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF), a dimensionality reduction technique widely used in various fields, including bioinformatics, image processing, and natural language processing. It allows users to decompose a given data matrix into two lower-dimensional matrices, representing the underlying patterns and features in the data.",
