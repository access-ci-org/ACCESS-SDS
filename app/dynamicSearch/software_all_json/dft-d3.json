    "comprehensive_overview": "DFT-D3 is a widely used dispersion correction method for density functional theory (DFT) calculations to accurately account for long-range dispersive interactions in molecular systems. It improves the description of non-bonded interactions, including van der Waals forces, and enhances the accuracy of DFT calculations.",
