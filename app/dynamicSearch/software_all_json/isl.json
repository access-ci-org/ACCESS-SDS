  "comprehensive_overview": "ISL (Integer Set Library) is a library for manipulating sets and maps of integer points bounded by linear constraints. It provides functions for computing the integer points in a set or projection of a set represented as unions of polyhedra, as wells as their images under affine transformations.",
