    "software_name": "gompic",
    "comprehensive_overview": "gompic is an open-source framework for simulating collective dynamics in soft matter systems with a focus on granular materials. It is designed to simulate the dynamics of large ensembles of particles undergoing complex interactions and can be used to study phenomena like granular flow, pattern formation, and self-organization.",
    "core_features": "1. Simulation of granular systems with complex interactions.\n2. Study of collective dynamics and emergent behaviors in soft matter.\n3. Analysis of granular flow, pattern formation, and self-organization.\n4. Open-source and customizable framework for research purposes.",
