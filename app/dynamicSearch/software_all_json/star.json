    "comprehensive_overview": "STAR (Spliced Transcripts Alignment to a Reference) is a RNA-seq read aligner that maps RNA-seq data to a reference genome to identify splice junctions between exons. It is particularly useful for mapping reads that span multiple exons, thereby aiding in the analysis of alternative splicing events.",
