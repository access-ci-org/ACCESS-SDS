    "comprehensive_overview": "MPC, short for Multi-Party Computation, is a cryptographic protocol that allows multiple parties to jointly compute a function over their inputs while keeping those inputs private. It ensures data privacy and security in collaborative computations.",
    "core_features": "1. Secure computation: Enables computation on private data without revealing the data to any of the parties involved. 2. Privacy-preserving protocols: Utilizes cryptographic techniques to ensure that the inputs remain confidential during computation. 3. Collaboration support: Facilitates cooperation between multiple parties in executing computations while maintaining privacy.",
