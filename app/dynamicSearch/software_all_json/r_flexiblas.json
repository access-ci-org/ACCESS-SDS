    "software_name": "r_flexiblas",
    "comprehensive_overview": "r_flexiblas is a software package for solving linear systems with block-angular structures. It is based on the pre-conditioned flexible GMRES iterative solver combined with a block-ILU(0) pre-conditioner. The software is written in R and primarily designed for efficient solution of large, sparse linear systems arising from computational simulations in various scientific and engineering disciplines.",
