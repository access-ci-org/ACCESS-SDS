    "comprehensive_overview": "Salmon is a wicked-fast program to provide quantification of transcript expression from RNA-seq data.",
    "core_features": "Salmon uses selective alignment of RNA-sequencing reads against a quasi index of the known transcripts to quickly determine the compatibility of the reads with the transcripts, and to quantify the abundance of the transcripts.To quantify expression levels, Salmon employs a two-phase inference procedure that is highly robust, accurate, and is faster than most other tools available.",
