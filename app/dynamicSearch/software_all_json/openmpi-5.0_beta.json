    "comprehensive_overview": "OpenMPI is an open-source Message Passing Interface (MPI) library that allows parallel computing on a distributed memory system. It enables high performance computing (HPC) by facilitating communication and coordination between processes running on multiple nodes.",
    "core_features": "1. Support for parallel computing using the MPI standard.\n2. Scalability and performance optimization for HPC applications.\n3. Fault tolerance and resilience features for handling node failures.\n4. Interoperability with different programming languages like C, C++, and Fortran.\n5. Dynamic process management and load balancing capabilities.",
