    "comprehensive_overview": "QEMU is a generic and open-source machine emulator and virtualizer that supports executing different operating systems and programs on a host operating system. It provides full system simulation, allowing users to run virtual machines with various architectures (x86, ARM, PowerPC, etc.) on a wide range of host platforms. QEMU can be used for various purposes such as development, testing, debugging, and virtualization.",
