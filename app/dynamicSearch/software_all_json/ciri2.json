    "comprehensive_overview": "CIRI2 (CircRNA Identifier 2) is a comprehensive computational tool designed to efficiently and accurately identify circular RNAs (circRNAs) from high-throughput sequencing data. CircRNAs are a type of non-coding RNA with crucial functions in gene regulation and various biological processes.",
    "core_features": "1. Detection of circRNAs: CIRI2 employs an algorithm that utilizes back-spliced reads to detect circRNAs within RNA-Seq data.\n2. High accuracy: The tool integrates multiple strategies to enhance the accuracy of circRNA identification.\n3. Multiple-file input: CIRI2 supports the analysis of multiple RNA-Seq samples simultaneously.\n4. Visualization capabilities: Users can visualize the identified circRNAs and their characteristics through graphical outputs.\n5. Customizable parameters: The tool offers flexibility in adjusting parameters based on user requirements.",
