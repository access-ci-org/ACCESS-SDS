   "software_name": "ExpansionHunter",
   "comprehensive_overview": "ExpansionHunter is a set of tools for detecting repeat expansions in whole genome sequencing data. It is specifically designed to identify repeat length differences that are associated with genetic diseases. ExpansionHunter scans the genome for such expansions and provides detailed information and visualizations to assist in variant interpretation.",
