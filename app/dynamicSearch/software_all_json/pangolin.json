    "software_name": "pangolin",
    "comprehensive_overview": "Pangolin is a software tool developed for assigning lineages to SARS-CoV-2 sequences. It uses a phylogenetic tree-based approach to assign viral lineages based on the mutation profiles of the sequences. Pangolin is widely used in tracking the evolution and spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.",
    "core_features": "1. Lineage assignment for SARS-CoV-2 sequences.
2. Phylogenetic tree-based lineage determination.
3. Monitoring the viral evolution and spread.
4. Integration with various bioinformatics tools and databases.",
