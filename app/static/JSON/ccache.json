    "AI Description": "ccache is a compiler cache tool designed to speed up C and C++ compilation by caching previous compilations. It acts as a caching proxy for compilers, storing compiled object files in a cache directory, which can be reused when the same compilation is done again. This reduces compilation times significantly, especially during iterative development processes.",
    "Core Features": [
        "Caching compiled object files for faster compilation times",
        "Transparently intercepting compiler calls",
        "Support for various compilers and build systems",
        "Customizable cache size and behavior",
        "Tracking dependencies to invalidate outdated cache entries"
