    "Software": "r-delayedarray",
    "AI Description": "The r-delayedarray package in R provides classes and methods for large-scale array-oriented calculations, particularly for array-like objects that are too large to fit into memory at once. It allows for efficient array storage and manipulation through delayed operations and memory-mapping to minimize memory usage and optimize performance.",
    "Core Features": "1. Support for large-scale array-oriented calculations\n2. Delayed operations for efficient memory usage\n3. Memory-mapping for optimized performance\n4. Integration with other R packages for data analysis and visualization",
