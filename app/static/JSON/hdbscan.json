    "AI Description": "HDBSCAN (Hierarchical Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) is a clustering algorithm that is based on density rather than distance, and in contrast to many other clustering algorithms, HDBSCAN has a parameterless approach that automatically determines the number of clusters in the data.",
    "Core Features": [
        "Density-based clustering",
        "Automatic cluster determination",
        "Ability to handle noise/outliers",
        "Scalable to large datasets",
        "Robust to different cluster geometries and densities"
