    "Software": "AlphaFold",
    "AI Description": "AlphaFold is a deep learning-based system developed by DeepMind to predict protein folding and 3D structure with high accuracy.",
    "Core Features": "AlphaFold uses a novel attention-based neural network architecture that interprets the amino acid sequence of a protein and predicts its 3D structure. It leverages evolutionary information from multiple sequence alignments to improve prediction accuracy. The system also provides confidence scores for its predictions.",
