    "Software": "R6",
    "AI Description": "R6 is an object-oriented programming system in R that allows for the creation of reference classes. It provides a way to define classes with reference semantics, similar to traditional object-oriented programming languages such as Java or C++. Reference classes allow for mutable objects and methods that can modify object state.",
    "Core Features": "Creation Of Reference Classes In R, Implementation Of Classical Object-Oriented Programming Concepts, Support For Mutable Objects, Methods That Can Modify Object State",
