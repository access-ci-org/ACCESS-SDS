    "Software": "R6",
    "AI Description": "R6 is an object-oriented programming system in R that allows for the creation of reference classes. It provides a way to define classes with reference semantics, similar to traditional object-oriented programming languages such as Java or C++. Reference classes allow for mutable objects and methods that can modify object state.",
    "Core Features": [
        "Creation of reference classes in R",
        "Implementation of classical object-oriented programming concepts",
        "Support for mutable objects",
        "Methods that can modify object state"
