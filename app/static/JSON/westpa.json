    "AI Description": "The Weighted Ensemble Simulation Toolkit for the Analysis of Rare Events (WESTPA) is an open-source software package designed to facilitate the description and analysis of rare events in complex systems. It employs a weighted ensemble-based strategy to efficiently sample and explore the configuration space of a system, particularly when traditional molecular dynamics simulations may struggle to capture rare events.",
    "Core Features": "1. Weighted ensemble simulation method for sampling rare events\n2. Analysis tools for estimating transition rates, reaction coordinates, and free energy landscapes\n3. Support for parallelization on high-performance computing resources\n4. Integration with popular simulation packages like GROMACS, AMBER, and NAMD\n5. Customizable options for simulation parameters and analysis techniques",
