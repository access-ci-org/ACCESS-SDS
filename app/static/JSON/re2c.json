    "AI Description": "re2c is a tool for writing fast and flexible lexer/scanner programs. It translates regular expressions into deterministic finite automata (DFA) and compiles them into C/C++ code. This allows for efficient lexical analysis of input streams.",
    "Core Features": [
        "Efficient generation of lexer/scanner programs",
        "Translation of regular expressions into DFA",
        "Compilation into C/C++ code",
        "Support for various lexing/scanning tasks"
