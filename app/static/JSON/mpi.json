    "Software": "MPI",
    "AI Description": "Message Passing Interface (MPI) is a standardized and portable message-passing system designed to enable scalable, parallel computing on a wide variety of parallel computers. It is widely used in the field of high-performance computing (HPC) to develop parallel programs that can run efficiently on distributed memory architectures.",
    "Core Features": [
        "Allows communication and data exchange between parallel processes",
        "Supports creation of parallel applications for distributed memory systems",
        "Facilitates coordination and synchronization of parallel tasks",
        "Scalable and efficient for large-scale parallel computing"
