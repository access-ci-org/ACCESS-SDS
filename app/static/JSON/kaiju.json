    "Software": "Kaiju",
    "AI Description": "Kaiju is a program for the taxonomic classification of high-throughput sequencing reads. It assigns taxonomic labels to short DNA sequences with near-perfect accuracy. Kaiju is based on the Burrows-Wheeler transform (BWT) and the FM-index. It has been designed to analyze sequencing reads generated by high-throughput sequencing technologies, such as Illumina, Pacific Biosciences, and Ion Torrent.",
    "Core Features": [
