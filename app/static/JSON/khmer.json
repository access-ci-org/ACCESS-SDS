    "Software": "Khmer",
    "AI Description": "Khmer is a set of tools for working with DNA sequence data that is extremely efficient both in terms of speed and memory consumption. It is designed to pre-process sequencing data to reduce the memory requirements of de Bruijn graph based assemblers for metagenome data. The tools can be used for counting k-mers and finding k-mers that occur many times, trimming and error-trimming data, digital normalization of reads, and partitioning large data sets.",
