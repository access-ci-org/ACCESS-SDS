    "AI Description": "PASA (Program to Assemble Spliced Alignments) is a eukaryotic genome annotation tool that uses multiple sources of experimental evidence to identify and improve gene structures. PASA Pipeline is a comprehensive software tool that automates and streamlines the process of gene structure annotation and improvement.",
    "Core Features": "1. Integration of various sources of evidence such as RNA-Seq reads, ESTs, and protein alignments to annotate gene structures. \n2. Automated identification of alternatively spliced isoforms. \n3. Improvement of gene structures through iterative alignment and assembly steps. \n4. Built-in support for visualization of gene structures and associated evidence.",
