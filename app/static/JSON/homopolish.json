    "AI Description": "Homopolish is a tool for polishing long-read assemblies using shorter reads. It takes long reads from a genome assembly and error-corrects them using short reads to produce a more accurate assembly.",
    "Core Features": [
        "Error correction of long-read assemblies using short reads",
        "Improving the accuracy of genome assemblies",
        "Facilitates the generation of high-quality genome assemblies"
