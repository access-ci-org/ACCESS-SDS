    "Software": "imbalanced-learn",
    "AI Description": "Imbalanced-learn is a Python library designed to tackle the problem of imbalanced datasets in machine learning. It provides a set of tools and techniques to deal with classification tasks where the distribution of classes is skewed, with one class significantly more frequent than the others.",
    "Core Features": [
        "Over-sampling techniques (SMOTE, ADASYN, etc.)",
        "Under-sampling techniques",
        "Combined over-sampling and under-sampling",
        "Ensemble techniques (BalancedRandomForestClassifier, RUSBoostClassifier)",
        "Cost-sensitive learning",
        "Support for scikit-learn pipeline integration"
