    "Software": "Charm++",
    "AI Description": "Charm++ is a parallel programming framework that aims to simplify the development of parallel applications by providing a flexible and scalable runtime system. It is particularly well-suited for irregular and dynamic applications that require adaptive load balancing and fault tolerance.",
    "Core Features": "1. Adaptive runtime system for dynamic load balancing\n2. Message-driven architecture for asynchronous communication\n3. Fault tolerance mechanisms for handling system failures\n4. Scalable performance on distributed memory systems\n5. Support for migration of computational entities across processors\n6. High-level abstractions for parallel programming",
