    "AI Description": "Model-based Analysis of ChIP-Seq (MACS) version 2 is a tool for identifying transcription factor binding sites and histone modification enrichment from ChIP-Seq data. It uses a dynamic Poisson distribution to effectively capture local biases in the genome while comparing the tag position density profiles between ChIP-Seq data and control samples.",
