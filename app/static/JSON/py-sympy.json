    "AI Description": "SymPy is a Python library for symbolic mathematics. It aims to become a full-featured computer algebra system (CAS) while keeping the code as simple as possible in order to be comprehensible and easily extensible. SymPy is written entirely in Python.",
    "Core Features": [
        "Supports various mathematical operations including algebraic and calculus operations, solving equations, simplification, and more",
        "Can be used to perform symbolic computation, manipulate and solve equations, integrate and differentiate, solve differential equations, and much more",
        "Provides a wide range of functionality for symbolic mathematics similar to systems like Mathematica or Maple but entirely in Python",
        "Free and open-source software with an active community maintaining and extending its capabilities",
        "Can be easily integrated into Python code and utilized for various mathematical tasks"
