    "AI Description": "TenPy is a Python library for the simulation of strongly correlated quantum lattice models. It includes algorithms for finding ground states and low-energy excitations, as well as for time evolution and thermal equilibrium states. The library is designed to work efficiently with tensor networks in one and two dimensions, such as matrix product states and projected entangled pair states.",
