    "Software": "HISAT2",
    "AI Description": "HISAT2 is a fast and sensitive alignment program for mapping next-generation sequencing reads (both DNA and RNA) against the general human population (as well as against a single reference genome). It builds on HISAT and Bowtie, allowing for significantly improved performance and new capabilities.",
    "Core Features": [
        "Fast and sensitive alignment of NGS reads",
        "Mapping of DNA and RNA reads",
        "Alignment against general human population or a single reference genome",
        "Improved performance and new capabilities compared to HISAT and Bowtie"
