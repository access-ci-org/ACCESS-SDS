    "AI Description": "cd-hit is a widely used program for clustering and comparing protein or nucleotide sequences. It clusters a large set of sequences to reduce redundancy and generate a non-redundant representative set. This tool is beneficial for sequence analysis, especially in bioinformatics studies.",
    "Core Features": "1. Clustering of protein or nucleotide sequences\n2. Reducing redundancy in large sequence datasets\n3. Generating non-redundant representative sequences\n4. Alignment-based and word-counting algorithms\n5. Various clustering and similarity threshold options",
