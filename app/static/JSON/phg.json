    "AI Description": "PHG (Population Hybrid Graphs) is a software package for analyzing genome-wide markers in a case-control population hybrid design. It is designed for detecting genomic regions that differ in allele frequency between cases and controls, considering ancestry information and accounting for linkage disequilibrium.",
