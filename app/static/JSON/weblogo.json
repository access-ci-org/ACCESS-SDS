    "AI Description": "WebLogo is a web-based application designed to create sequence logos from biological sequence alignments. Sequence logos are graphical representations of the patterns within a multiple sequence alignment, where each position in the alignment is represented by a stack of symbols reflecting the conservation at that position.",
    "Core Features": [
        "Generate sequence logos from multiple sequence alignments",
        "Customize the appearance of sequence logos with various options",
        "Interact with the generated logos to explore the sequence conservation patterns",
        "Download the logos in various formats for use in publications or presentations"
