    "AI Description": "compiler-rt stands for Compiler Runtime Library. It is a collection of runtime libraries that provide low-level support for compiler-generated code. It is designed to be used with the LLVM compiler infrastructure and is commonly used in conjunction with Clang. The compiler-rt libraries implement runtime parts of the language features that are not supported directly by the compiler.",
