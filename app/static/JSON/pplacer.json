    "Software": "pplacer",
    "AI Description": "pplacer is a phylogenetic placement tool that places query sequences on a fixed reference phylogenetic tree while simultaneously estimating their likelihoods. It is particularly useful for analyzing large collections of short reads, such as those generated from next-generation sequencing technologies.",
