    "Software": "Orca",
    "AI Description": "Orca is a flexible, efficient, and powerful quantum chemistry software written by Frank Neese and co-workers. It provides accurate and reliable computational simulations of molecular structures and properties based on quantum mechanical methods.",
    "Core Features": "Orca offers a wide range of quantum chemical methods, including Density Functional Theory (DFT), ab initio Hartree-Fock, and many post-Hartree-Fock methods. It can perform geometry optimizations, transition state searches, and molecular dynamics simulations. Orca also supports a variety of spectroscopic properties calculations, such as NMR chemical shifts, electronic circular dichroism (ECD) spectra, and UV/Vis spectra.",
