    "Software": "R-Matrix",
    "AI Description": "R-Matrix is a widely used computational method for solving the Schroedinger's equation in quantum mechanics, particularly in atomic and molecular physics. It is based on the R-matrix theory which divides space into two regions and the wave function into inner and outer regions, allowing the solution of the wave function to be determined separately in each region and then matched at the boundary. This method is commonly used to study electron-ion collisions, atomic photoionization, and other atomic and molecular processes.",
