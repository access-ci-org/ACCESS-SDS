    "Software": "Hyperopt",
    "AI Description": "Hyperopt is a Python library for optimizing over arbitrary search spaces. The main goal of Hyperopt is to provide a flexible and expressive architecture for an optimization workforce, including hyperparameter optimization, machine learning and statistics.",
    "Core Features": "1. Distributed optimization: Hyperopt can distribute the optimization process across multiple compute nodes.\n2. Parallel execution: Allows for parallel evaluation of the objective function.\n3. Plug and play: Easily integrates with different Python libraries and frameworks, such as scikit-learn.\n4. Support for various algorithms: Supports different optimization algorithms like TPE (Tree-structured Parzen Estimator) and random search.\n5. Scalability: Can handle optimization problems with a large number of parameters efficiently.",
