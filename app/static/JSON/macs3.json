    "Software": "MACS3",
    "AI Description": "MACS3 (Model-based analysis of ChIP-Seq) is a software tool specifically designed for identifying genome-wide protein-DNA interaction sites from ChIP-Seq data. It uses a dynamic Poisson distribution to model the background noise and captures the spatial correlation of the ChIP-Seq data to improve peak detection accuracy.",
