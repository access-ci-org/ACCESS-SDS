    "AI Description": "scGen is a deep learning framework for generating bulk-level transcriptomic profiles from single-cell RNA-sequencing data. It predicts the influence of genetic and environmental factors on gene expression at a population-level, bridging the resolution gap between single-cell and bulk-level omics data.",
    "Core Features": [
        "Generates bulk-level transcriptomic profiles from scRNA-seq data",
        "Predicts gene expression influenced by genetic and environmental factors",
        "Bridges resolution gap between single-cell and bulk-level omics data",
        "Utilizes deep learning techniques for modeling gene expression"
