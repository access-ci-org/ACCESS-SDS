    "Software": "VirtualGL",
    "AI Description": "VirtualGL is an open-source toolkit that enables the 3D acceleration of applications that are running on a remote server. It redirects the 3D rendering commands from a Unix/Linux OpenGL application onto a server-side GPU and converts the rendered 3D images into a video stream that is sent to the client-side for display using a high-speed network connection.",
    "Core Features": [
        "Enables 3D acceleration of applications on remote servers",
        "Supports OpenGL applications on Unix/Linux systems",
        "Utilizes server-side GPU for rendering",
        "Transmits rendered 3D images to the client-side for display"
