    "Software": "IQ-TREE",
    "AI Description": "IQ-TREE is a versatile and fast software tool for maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree estimation. It implements a wide range of models for nucleotide and amino acid sequences, including substitution models, clock models, and site-specific rate variation. IQ-TREE also provides rigorous statistical tests to evaluate the robustness of the inferred phylogenies. It supports large phylogenomic data sets and offers parallel computing capabilities for efficient analysis.",
