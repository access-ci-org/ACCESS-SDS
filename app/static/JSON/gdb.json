    "AI Description": "GDB, the GNU Project debugger, allows you to see what is going on 'inside' another program while it executes or what another program was doing at the moment it crashed.",
    "Core Features": "1. Source-level debugging: Supports multiple languages and allows debugging programs written in C, C++, Ada, Fortran, Go, and more. \n2. Breakpoint management: Set breakpoints to pause the program execution at a specified point for inspection. \n3. Watchpoints and catchpoints: Monitor and halt program execution when certain memory locations are accessed or when specific exception conditions occur. \n4. Call stack and variables: View and manipulate the call stack, examine variables, and evaluate expressions. \n5. Reverse debugging: Allows stepping backward through program execution to understand the causes of unexpected behavior.",
