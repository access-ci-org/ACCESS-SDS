    "AI Description": "PAML (Phylogenetic Analysis by Maximum Likelihood) is a package of programs for phylogenetic analysis of DNA or protein sequences using maximum likelihood. It provides a wide range of tools for evolutionary analysis and inference in a phylogenetic context.",
    "Core Features": "Key features of PAML include phylogeny inference, evolutionary rate estimation, branch-site and branch-specific models, selection analysis, divergence time estimation, and codon models. It allows users to perform various tests and analyses to understand the evolutionary mechanisms underlying sequence data.",
