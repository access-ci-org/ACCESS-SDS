    "AI Description": "Numexpr is a fast numerical expression evaluator for NumPy. With it, expressions that operate on arrays (like '3*a+4*b') are accelerated and use less memory than doing the same calculation in Python. In addition, its multi-threaded capabilities can make use of all your cores in a CPU.",
    "Core Features": [
        "Accelerated numerical expression evaluation for NumPy arrays",
        "Optimized for performance and memory usage",
        "Multi-threaded capabilities for improved speed using multiple CPU cores"
