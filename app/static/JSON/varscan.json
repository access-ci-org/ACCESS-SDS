    "Software": "VarScan",
    "AI Description": "VarScan is a platform-independent variant caller for massively parallel sequencing data, focused on variant discovery in next-generation sequencing data. It detects germline variants, somatic mutations, and copy number alterations (CNVs) based on multi-sample or paired tumor-normal data.",
    "Core Features": [
        "Detects germline variants, somatic mutations, and CNVs",
        "Supports multi-sample or paired tumor-normal data",
        "Enables the use of both DNA-Seq and RNA-Seq data",
        "Provides statistical and heuristical methods for variant calling",
        "Generates detailed variant calls including genotype, read depth, frequency, and quality"
