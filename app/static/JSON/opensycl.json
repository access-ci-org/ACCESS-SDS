    "Software": "openSYCL",
    "AI Description": "openSYCL is an open-source implementation of the SYCL standard, which is a higher-level programming model for developing C++ applications on heterogeneous systems with various accelerators such as GPUs, FPGAs, and other specialized processing units. It enables developers to write single-source C++ code that can target a variety of hardware accelerators without the need for low-level programming.",
    "Core Features": "1. Compatibility with heterogeneous systems\n2. Simplified parallel programming with C++\n3. Targeting GPUs, FPGAs, and other accelerators\n4. Open-source implementation\n5. Enables single-source C++ programming for various devices",
