    "AI Description": "ABPOA (adaptive bi-path overlap aligner) is a multiple sequence alignment tool that employs a novel bi-path structure to generate pairwise alignments between sequences for constructing a multiple sequence alignment. It is designed to align long noisy read sequences efficiently and accurately by adapting to local alignment conditions.",
    "Core Features": "1. Utilizes a bi-path structure for pairwise sequence alignment\n2. Designed for aligning long noisy read sequences\n3. Adapts to local alignment conditions to improve accuracy\n4. Efficient and scalable for handling large datasets",
