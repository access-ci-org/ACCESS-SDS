    "Software": "STAR",
    "AI Description": "STAR (Spliced Transcripts Alignment to a Reference) is a RNA-seq read aligner that maps RNA-seq data to a reference genome to identify splice junctions between exons. It is particularly useful for mapping reads that span multiple exons, thereby aiding in the analysis of alternative splicing events.",
    "Core Features": [
        "Alignment of RNA-seq reads to a reference genome",
        "Identification of splice junctions",
        "Analysis of alternative splicing events"
