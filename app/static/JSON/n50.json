    "Software": "n50",
    "AI Description": "n50 is a metric commonly used in genomics to assess the assembly quality of a set of contigs or scaffolds. It represents the contig or scaffold length where at least 50% of the total genome size is contained in contigs or scaffolds of equal or greater length.",
    "Core Features": [
        "Calculates N50 value for genome assemblies",
        "Quality assessment of genome assembly",
        "Evaluation of contig or scaffold lengths in genomics"
