    "AI Description": "SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) is a unified approach to explain the output of any machine learning model. It connects game theory with local explanations, attributing the impact of each feature on a model's predictions.",
    "Core Features": "1. Provides unified approach for explaining machine learning models.\n2. Utilizes Shapley values from cooperative game theory for local feature attributions.\n3. Supports various model types including tree-based models, deep learning models, and more.\n4. Helps understand the impact of individual features on model predictions.\n5. Enables model interpretability and transparency for better decision making.",
