    "AI Description": "Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (BWA) is a software package for mapping low-divergent sequences against a large reference genome, such as the human genome. It consists of three algorithms: BWA-backtrack, BWA-SW, and BWA-MEM. The BWA-backtrack algorithm is designed for Illumina sequence reads up to 100bp, while BWA-SW and BWA-MEM are for longer Illumina reads, including 100bp reads produced by the HiSeq 2000 platform.",
