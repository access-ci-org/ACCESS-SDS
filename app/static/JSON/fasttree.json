    "Software": "FastTree",
    "AI Description": "FastTree is a tool for inferring approximately-maximum-likelihood phylogenetic trees from alignments of nucleotide or protein sequences. FastTree can handle alignments with up to a few thousand sequences and has been designed to make trees with the minimum scale up to 100,000 sequences faster by approximating maximum-likelihood with heuristics.",
    "Core Features": [
        "Inference of approximately-maximum-likelihood phylogenetic trees",
        "Support for both nucleotide and protein sequences",
        "Efficient handling of alignments with thousands of sequences",
        "Speed optimization for large-scale datasets"
