    "Software": "NGSadmix",
    "AI Description": "NGSadmix is a software tool used for analyzing genetic admixture, which is the result of mixing genetic material from different ancestral populations within a population or individual. It is specifically designed to estimate individual admixture proportions and infer the number of ancestral populations contributing to a target population.",

        "Estimation of individual admixture proportions",
        "Identification of ancestral populations contributing to a target population",
        "Model-based approach for genetic admixture analysis"
