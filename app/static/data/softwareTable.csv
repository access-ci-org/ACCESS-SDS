Sequences that were initially identified as “unclassified” are compared to all of the groups using position specific log-odds scores as described by Henikoff and Henikoff. Positions in the aligned sequences that are important for determining group membership are identified by having a high entropy for the entire alignment and a high entropy for one or more specific groups.

Based on an extension of BWT for graphs (Sirén et al. 2014), we designed and implemented a graph FM index (GFM), an original approach and its first implementation. In addition to using one global GFM index that represents a population of human genomes, HISAT2 uses a large set of small GFM indexes that collectively cover the whole genome. These small indexes (called local indexes), combined with several alignment strategies, enable rapid and accurate alignment of sequencing reads. This new indexing scheme is called a Hierarchical Graph FM index (HGFM).

infernal,"Anvil, Bridges-2",,,,,,"Infernal (""INFERence of RNA ALignment"") is for searching DNA sequence databases for RNA structure and sequence similarities. It is an implementation of a special case of profile stochastic context-free grammars called covariance models (CMs). A CM is like a sequence profile, but it scores a combination of sequence consensus and RNA secondary structure consensus, so in many cases, it is more capable of identifying RNA homologs that conserve their secondary structure more than their primary sequence.
